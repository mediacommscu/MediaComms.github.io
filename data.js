It questions whether they&rsquo;re shown with the same depth and respect as Western musicians or if they&rsquo;re framed through reductive lenses. <br />Afrobeats has gone global in the past few years, and the artists are now getting features in magazines like Vogue or Billboard. But with all that attention comes the question of how these artists are being portrayed and whether the visibility matches the complexity of who they are.<br />Using theories of media representation, postcolonialism and transmedia storytelling, the project looks at how magazines and their digital extensions frame these artists and what that framing says about power, cultural positioning and image. This study includes ideas like framing theory, cultural imperialism, hybridity and spectacle performance to explain why certain stories get pushed more than others and how identity can be shaped by media. In the media artefact, the concept of synthetic personalisation (Fairclough, 1989) was used to help build a sense of connection between the artist and the reader without falling into branding or stereotype.<br />The research takes a qualitative approach, combining content analysis, critical discourse analysis and practice based research. I analysed nine artist features from Billboard, GQ and Dazed, focusing on the articles and Instagram content used to promote them. I analysed 6 Afrobeats artists and 3 Western artists to see if there were differences in how they were represented. I also looked at Cosmopolitan UK&rsquo;s &ldquo;Up Close&rdquo; YouTube series to compare how Afrobeats artists are framed in personality driven content versus their Western peers. I also used a short audience questionnaire and Google Trends to back up the growing interest in Afrobeats and how people engage with these artists online.<br />The findings showed that Afrobeats artists are more visible now, but that visibility often comes at a cost. The media focuses more on their style and image than who they are as people. They get called things like &ldquo;trailblazer&rdquo; which sounds like praise but actually flattens them or makes them feel distant. The visuals are usually high fashion but not always culturally grounded. In contrast, Western artists are shown as full people with emotions, stories and complexity. Audience feedback also showed a mix of pride and frustration. Fans were happy to see African artists in these spaces but also wanted deeper, more personal and culturally honest portrayals.<br />To respond to all of this, I created YUTE Magazine, a digital platform that centres African artists, especially upcoming ones, without filtering them through a Western lens. I worked with an artist called MAY0 and built everything from the interview to the photoshoot to show her in full &ndash; as a Nigerian woman, an artist and a human being. <br />In the end, this project showed that representation is more than just being seen. It&rsquo;s about how you&rsquo;re seen and who gets to shape that view. And until more platforms are built by people who understand the culture, the story will keep being told the wrong way.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>INTRODUCTION<br />In the past few years, Afrobeats has gone from a regional sound to a global force. With this rise has come increased media attention, especially from major Western platforms. Getting featured in magazines like Vogue, GQ or Billboard signals validation, boosts visibility, and can shape an artist&rsquo;s image on a global scale. In today&rsquo;s industry, a strong magazine feature can be just as impactful as a music release, influencing how artists are perceived by fans, gatekeepers, and the media (Garner, 2020). While Afrobeats is becoming more mainstream, the way it&rsquo;s presented in Western media often lacks depth, reducing the artists into types rather than showing their full complexity. <br />This project uses media representation, postcolonial theory, and digital storytelling to analyse how Afrobeats artists are framed in Western magazines and digital extensions, and whether those portrayals give them the same respect as their Western peers. A lot of existing media analysis focuses on either traditional representation theory or general globalisation trends, but few connect these directly to how Afrobeats artists are represented across platforms. This project fills that gap, offering both a critical analysis and a creative response via the creation of YUTE MAGAZINE, that reimagines how these artists can be shown, not just seen.</p>\n<p>LITERATURE REVIEW<br />This literature review lays the foundation for analysing how Afrobeats artists are represented in Western media, across print and digital platforms. It focuses on three main areas: Representation, Postcolonial Theory, and Transmediality. These concepts provide a structured framework for analysing how Afrobeats artists are framed across platforms, and how those frames influence audience perception and cultural positioning.</p>\n<p>REPRESENTATION<br />Afrobeats&rsquo; commercial success and widespread appeal have positioned African artists on international stages, challenging outdated stereotypes and reshaping narratives about the continent. As Yusif (2024) states, &ldquo;The influence of Afrobeats extends far beyond the realm of music, playing a crucial role in redefining Africa's image within the global consciousness&rdquo; (p.51). At the core of Afrobeats are the artists themselves, whose representation in the media shapes these narratives. How they are framed depends on how media outlets construct their image.<br />Swanson (1991) defines representation as &ldquo;...the way images and language actively construct meanings according to sets of conventions shared by and familiar to makers and audiences.&rdquo; This suggests media doesn&rsquo;t just reflect reality, it creates meaning through patterns. Hall (1997) expands on this by saying meaning is not fixed, it is shaped through discourse and depends on context and audience reception. Representation determines which narratives are amplified or ignored, and how artists are framed for global audiences. One way this happens is through framing.<br />Framing, as explained by Entman (1993), means highlighting certain parts of reality while downplaying others. These choices influence how people interpret meaning and what perspectives become dominant. In the case of Afrobeats, framing shapes how artists are positioned within global music culture. Western magazines and their digital platforms help define their visibility and legitimacy. Hall (1980) adds that media messages are encoded with cultural meanings, meaning representations aren&rsquo;t neutral, they&rsquo;re shaped by symbols and language that reflect certain ideas and beliefs.<br />Media also constructs how Afrobeats artists appear as celebrities or icons. Dyer (1998) explains that celebrity images are not just personal expressions but constructed by media systems to reflect broader social values. Even when an artist seems authentic, their image often reinforces dominant norms. Marshall (2014) agrees, arguing that even &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; celebrity identities usually still fit within what&rsquo;s culturally and economically acceptable in the West. This raises questions about whether Afrobeats artists are truly being represented on their own terms or simply reshaped to fit Western standards.<br />Hooks (1992) takes this further with her concept of hypervisibility. Black artists may be widely seen in media, but often only in limited, stereotypical ways. That kind of visibility can feel like erasure, where presence doesn&rsquo;t equal full recognition or power.<br />Together, these ideas help explain how Afrobeats artists are portrayed in Western media. Not just whether they appear, but how they are shown, and what those portrayals really mean.</p>\n<p>POST-COLONIAL THEORY<br />Postcolonial theory helps explain why Afrobeats artists are framed in certain ways in Western media. It focuses on the lasting impact of colonialism on culture, power, and identity, especially in how formerly colonised people are portrayed and understood (Ashcroft, Griffiths, &amp; Tiffin, 2007). Fanon (1961) argues that colonialism didn&rsquo;t just take land, it also reshaped how colonised people saw themselves. That psychological impact didn&rsquo;t go away with independence. In today&rsquo;s media, you can still see traces of it. Afrobeats artists might feel the need to present their culture in \"safe\" or familiar ways just to be accepted by global (Western) audiences. This helps explain why some artists are more popular or palatable than others. Not necessarily because of their talent, but because of how they fit into Western expectations.<br />Bhabha&rsquo;s (1994) idea of hybridity builds on this. He explains how colonised cultures don&rsquo;t just resist or copy the dominant one, they blend both, creating something new. Afrobeats is a good example of that. Artists might wear global fashion, use Western style production, but still hold on to African languages or cultural references. Bhabha also talks about mimicry, where it looks like they&rsquo;re copying Western norms but are really using those tools to re-centre African creativity. This gives artists a way to resist being boxed in, even if they&rsquo;re using the tools of the global system.<br />Cultural imperialism helps explain how these global expectations are maintained and normalised. Schiller (1976) describes it as the way Western media spreads not just content, but values, shaping how people around the world see themselves. Tomlinson (1991/2001) adds that this isn&rsquo;t always obvious. A lot of it happens through entertainment, not politics. Gramsci&rsquo;s (1971) idea of hegemony fits here. Power is kept not just by force, but by shaping what people see as \"normal.\" So, when artists sign to Western labels, or get featured by Western Magazines, it feels like success. But that&rsquo;s because Western platforms still control what counts as valuable.<br />Even so, not everyone agrees that African artists are just being used. Ntarangwi (2009) says African musicians use music to resist marginalisation and shape identity. Adegoke (2015) also points out that Afrobeats has helped change how young Africans in the diaspora see themselves. She says it made British Africans feel proud of their heritage. Independent platforms like 49th Street and The Native Mag show how Africans are now telling their own stories, without needing approval from the usual Western media gatekeepers.<br />&emsp;<br />TRANSMEDIALITY AND AUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT<br />In today&rsquo;s digital media landscape, Afrobeats artists are represented across multiple platforms that shape how they are seen globally. As McLuhan (1964) argued, &ldquo;the medium is the message,&rdquo; meaning the platform used matters just as much as the content itself. A cover feature in Billboard, for example, may carry more industry weight than a 15 second clip from Billboard&rsquo;s TikTok account, even if both reach wide audiences. Jenkins (2006) calls this transmedia storytelling, when different platforms each add to the overall narrative. For artists, that includes music videos, social media, interviews, live shows and more. No single platform gives the full picture, but together they build the artist&rsquo;s image.<br />Western magazines have adapted to this environment through media convergence. Chadha and Kavoori (2015) explain this as the blending of traditional journalism with digital tools. Magazines now produce articles, video content, social media clips and track engagement in real time. Audience response has become part of editorial decision making. This is also about business. Western magazines are media companies, and their choices are shaped by what attracts clicks and shares. Couldry (2012) reminds us that media is both culture and commerce. Representation, then, isn&rsquo;t just about creativity, it&rsquo;s also about metrics.<br />Platforms don&rsquo;t just carry content, they shape visibility. Yengin and Bayrak (2023) argue platforms influence how people see themselves and others. Okonkwo et al. (2024) describe them as battlegrounds for cultural expression, where dominant interests still influence who gets seen. Noble (2018) notes that platform algorithms often favour content that aligns with Western norms, making it harder for culturally specific stories to reach wide audiences. Couldry and Mejias (2019) call this &ldquo;data colonialism,&rdquo; where platforms benefit from global users while reinforcing Western dominance.<br />Abercrombie and Longhurst&rsquo;s (1998) spectacle performance theory also helps explain this. They say celebrity isn&rsquo;t fixed, it&rsquo;s performed across appearances. Afrobeats artists build their public image through interviews, photoshoots, and posts that align with what each platform expects. When magazines frame them, they&rsquo;re not just representing the artist, they&rsquo;re creating a version of them that fits within marketable norms.<br />Together, transmedia storytelling, convergence, and audience engagement shape how Afrobeats artists are selected, presented and circulated in global media spaces.</p>\n<p>Together, these frameworks help make sense of the different ways Western magazines frame Afrobeats artists and why those frames matter. They set the groundwork for analysing who gets to control the story, how the artists are framed, and how that changes depending on the platform.</p>\n<p><br />RESEARCH AIM, QUESTIONS AND OBJECTIVES</p>\n<p>RESEARCH AIM<br />To investigate how Afrobeats artists are represented in Western magazines and their digital platforms, and to examine whether they are portrayed with the same artistic respect as mainstream Western pop artists or framed through exoticized or reductive narratives.</p>\n<p>RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br />1. How are Afrobeats artists visually and textually represented in Western magazines and their online platforms?<br />2. Do these representations show them as respected artists or as cultural spectacles?<br />3. How do magazines decide which Afrobeats artists to feature, and how do those choices shape their portrayal?<br />4. How do postcolonial dynamics and commercial factors affect how Afrobeats artists are represented in Western media?</p>\n<p>OBJECTIVES<br />1. To analyse the visual and written portrayals of selected Afrobeats artists in Western magazines and digital platforms.<br />2. To compare how Afrobeats and Western artists are framed in terms of tone, style, and cultural positioning.<br />3. To apply representation, postcolonial, and media convergence theories to explore how race, power, and commerce shape artist portrayal.<br />4. To assess how audience engagement and platform strategies influence editorial framing.<br />5. To respond to these gaps through the creation of YUTE Magazine as an alternative representation model.<br />&emsp;<br />RESEARCH METHODS<br />This study uses a mixed method, qualitative approach that combines a questionnaire, content analysis, critical discourse analysis, and practice based research.</p>\n<p>QUESTIONNAIRE<br />The questionnaire helped capture audience perceptions of how Afrobeats artists are represented in Western media. It confirmed the relevance of the topic and helped shape the direction of both the content analysis and the practical output.</p>\n<p>CONTENT ANALYSIS<br />This was the primary research method used to examine media content across platforms, focusing on recurring themes, language, visuals, and narrative framing (Krippendorff, 2018). The analysis included magazine articles, social media posts, and YouTube interviews.</p>\n<p>MAGAZINE ARTICLE ANALYSIS<br />I analysed six articles from Billboard, Dazed, and GQ, and one Western pop artist from each for comparison:<br />&bull; Billboard: Burna Boy (2022), Tyla (2024), Justin Bieber (2015)<br />&bull; Dazed: Rema (2025), Ayra Starr (2024), Doechii (2025)<br />&bull; GQ: Wizkid (2022), Tems (2022), Beyonc&eacute; (2024)<br />I analysed both text and visuals to assess how Afrobeats artists were positioned in comparison to their Western peers.</p>\n<p>SOCIAL MEDIA POST ANALYSIS<br />I looked at Instagram posts used to promote the magazine features, focusing on:<br />&bull; Chosen images<br />&bull; Pull quotes<br />&bull; Tone and framing<br />This helped show how editorial decisions are shaped by platform and audience expectations.</p>\n<p>YOUTUBE INTERVIEW ANALYSIS<br />Though the magazines didn&rsquo;t offer interviews for all the analysed artists, I included relevant YouTube content:<br />&bull; Ayra Starr &ndash; Cosmopolitan UK &ldquo;Up Close&rdquo;<br />&bull; Madison Beer &ndash; Cosmopolitan UK &ldquo;Up Close&rdquo; (for comparison)<br />This helped assess how personality focused content frames Afrobeats artists versus their Western counterparts.</p>\n<p>GOOGLE TRENDS DATA<br />Google Trends was used to track global interest in \"Afrobeats\" from 2020&ndash;2024. Results showed rising interest in the UK and US, supporting the choice to focus on this time period and selection of featured artists.<br />&emsp;<br />CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS (CDA)<br />CDA was used to uncover how media language reinforces power dynamics. CDA revealed that Afrobeats artists were often dehumanised with language that might seem complimentary but are really flattening their personalities. It also revealed that western artists were given more autonomy in their articles and that the language used to describe them is more accurate. CDA made it clear that this isn&rsquo;t just about language reflecting bias. Language builds identity, and the way artists are described shapes who gets seen as fully human, and who doesn&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p>PRACTICE AS RESEARCH: YUTE MAGAZINE<br />To respond to the issues identified in my research, I created YUTE Magazine. It includes:<br />&bull; An in-depth interview with MAY0<br />&bull; A full cover photoshoot<br />&bull; social media (Instagram) and YouTube content<br />YUTE aimed to centre the artist&rsquo;s voice and identity without filtering it through the usual Western lens. It offered a more grounded and accurate way of representing Afrobeats artists.</p>\n<p>Using qualitative and practice based methods, this study aims to provide a deeper understanding of how Afrobeats artists are represented in Western media, and to offer a practical example of how they can be portrayed more accurately and respectfully.<br />&emsp;<br />ANALYSIS<br />This section explores how Afrobeats artists are represented across the magazine articles, photoshoots, and digital content selected for this project. It draws on the key concepts outlined in the literature review, particularly those related to representation, postcolonial theory, and transmediality. Each section looks at what kind of patterns kept showing up and how these shape the way Afrobeats artists are shown to global audiences.</p>\n<p>REPRESENTATION<br />Across the magazines and digital content, it&rsquo;s clear that Western media still picks and chooses which parts of an Afrobeats artist&rsquo;s identity get shown. What&rsquo;s presented is often filtered through a Western lens, even when the intention seems celebratory. In GQ and Dazed, artists like Wizkid and Rema are styled in ways that appeal globally but lack cultural grounding. Wizkid&rsquo;s GQ look was sleek and deliberately un-African. Rema&rsquo;s visuals lean into Afrofuturism but strip out any visible Nigerian context. This shows that Western media still favours aesthetics that feel universal, even if that means losing depth.<br />This shows up in the writing too. Billboard called Wizkid&rsquo;s sound &ldquo;Afro-pop,&rdquo; instead of Afrobeats which waters down the genre&rsquo;s roots. Burna Boy was framed as a &ldquo;trailblazer,&rdquo; detaching him from the wider Afrobeats movement. These terms isolate or elevate certain artists in ways that align with each magazine&rsquo;s brand image rather than the artist&rsquo;s cultural story. These choices reflect Entman&rsquo;s (1993) framing theory: media highlights certain meanings and erases others to suit its narrative.<br />Meanwhile, Western artists like Beyonc&eacute; and Doechii are given more room to show who they are. Beyonc&eacute;&rsquo;s GQ feature discusses her legacy, spirituality, and business power. Doechii&rsquo;s Dazed article lets her be messy, theatrical, and complex. Ayra Starr&rsquo;s feature tried something similar but played it safer. She was described as a &ldquo;rising star,&rdquo; not someone fully in control, fitting Marshall&rsquo;s (2014) idea that even alternative images often reinforce dominant norms about who gets to lead.<br />Hooks&rsquo; (1992) idea of hypervisibility is useful here. Afrobeats artists are more visible than ever, but not always fully seen. Their presence is mostly visual but the cultural, political, or even personal parts of their identity? That&rsquo;s often left out or softened. In most of the shoots, there&rsquo;s no clear sense of where they&rsquo;re from or what they stand for beyond being cool.<br />So, while Afrobeats artists are gaining media attention, their representation is still shaped by what Western platforms think global audiences want, not by who the artists actually are.</p>\n<p>POSTCOLONIALISM<br />Said&rsquo;s (1978) concept of Orientalism explains how the West has historically framed non-Western cultures as exotic or mysterious. This still shows up in how Afrobeats artists are described. Rema and Tems, for example, were written about as &ldquo;zen&rdquo; or &ldquo;spiritual,&rdquo; which makes them feel symbolic rather than real. Their visuals reflected this too. Tems is styled in goddess like poses, Rema in dark, moody shots that lean into mystique over personality. It might seem like praise, but it flattens them into tropes and takes away from their full humanity. This echoes what Said warned about: turning people into symbols that serve the Western imagination.<br />This also ties into Gramsci&rsquo;s (1971) idea of hegemony. In the global music scene, Western approval is still the gold standard. Even when the talent and sound are African, success is often measured by Western platforms like Billboard or the Grammys. Schiller (1976) and Tomlinson (1991) call this cultural imperialism: when Western media and systems still shape what counts as valuable, even in non-Western genres. This contrast becomes clearer when compared to Western artists. Artists like Justin Bieber and Beyonc&eacute; are allowed to be complex. Their struggles, emotions, and creativity are all part of the narrative. But Afrobeats artists are often tied back to culture or genre. Ayra Starr, for example, said she wants to be an African superstar, but Dazed still framed her using phrases like &ldquo;Celestial Being&rdquo; alongside mythical, nature based visuals. <br />Still, not all of this framing is passive. Bhabha&rsquo;s (1994) theory of hybridity helps explain how Afrobeats artists play with both African and Western aesthetics to create something new. Some of Ayra&rsquo;s visuals sit in that in-between space. Bold and editorial, but with nods to her roots. She wears earthy tones, minimal makeup, and lets her identity show without over explaining it. This blend shows how artists are navigating a postcolonial media space by remixing influences on their own terms. And when paired with her quote &ldquo;I wanted to be an African superstar&rdquo;, it shows that global appeal doesn&rsquo;t have to mean watering down your identity. So even in a media system that wasn&rsquo;t made for them, artists like Ayra are reclaiming their narrative and reshaping what African success can look like.</p>\n<p>TRANSMEDIALITY AND AUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT<br />Representation of Afrobeats artists doesn&rsquo;t just happen in articles, it spreads across platforms, each one framing them differently. Jenkins (2006) calls this transmedia storytelling: every format adds a new layer. Most artists in this study had a mix of magazine spreads, Instagram posts, and sometimes YouTube interviews, each showing a different version of them.<br />Ayra Starr is a clear example. For the article and on Instagram, Dazed frames her as mystical and polished but in her Cosmopolitan UK &ldquo;Up Close&rdquo; video, she was relaxed and funny. These differing depictions show how media framing is platform specific and isn&rsquo;t just based on editorial decisions but also based on what each brand thinks will resonate with their audience. Couldry (2012) reminds us media is shaped by engagement. Whether something gets clicks or shares often decides how it&rsquo;s presented.<br />But not every artist gets the same freedom. In her Cosmopolitan interview, Madison Beer was allowed to be soft spoken and vulnerable. Ayra Starr, on the other hand, was framed as a representation of African pride, ambition, and cultural legacy, even in a casual format. That contrast shows how media framing can still subtly gatekeep who gets to be &ldquo;relatable&rdquo; and who gets turned into a symbol.<br />Audience reception adds another layer. Comments under Ayra Starr&rsquo;s Dazed post were mixed. Some praised the fashion, calling her &ldquo;ethereal,&rdquo; while others felt the styling leaned too Western. Rema&rsquo;s features also got love for being stylish but was simultaneously criticised for lacking cultural depth. This shows audiences aren&rsquo;t just consuming, they&rsquo;re interpreting and pushing back. Noble (2018) argues that platforms tend to boost content that fits Western norms, which makes it harder for non-Western stories to break through without compromise. So even when Afrobeats artists appear in big publications, their stories are still shaped by what&rsquo;s globally palatable. Abercrombie and Longhurst&rsquo;s (1998) spectacle performance theory ties it all together. Afrobeats artists are represented through what looks good, what goes viral, or what fits a brand&rsquo;s aesthetic. The result is curated and often disconnected from the artist&rsquo;s full self. Not wrong but not fully right either.</p>\n<p>HOW YUTE RESPONDS TO THESE GAPS<br />After analysing how Afrobeats artists are often framed in Western magazines and their extensions, it was obvious that something was missing. A lot of the visuals were nice but didn&rsquo;t feel that deep. They focused on being fashion forward but downplayed anything that felt cultural or personal. Even the articles, when they weren&rsquo;t calling artists &ldquo;cool&rdquo; or &ldquo;spiritual,&rdquo; still found a way to flatten them into something that fit Western ideas of what African artists should be. It felt like they were being seen, but not really seen. This is exactly the gap I tried to fill with YUTE Magazine, a platform I created specifically to reframe how African artists, particularly upcoming ones, are presented. Every part of this project was led by me and built from the ground up to show an alternative way of representing African artists. <br />In the feature article, &ldquo;MAY0: Unfiltered&rdquo;, an in depth interview was conducted (my classmate, Christine was the interviewer, and she used the questions I created while following my direction to ensure the conversation followed the tone and focus I had planned) with a rising Afrobeats artist, MAY0, who also happens to be based in the diaspora. Instead of making her story fit into a Western template, the questions I developed were designed to let her voice lead. We covered everything from the emotions in her music, to how she balances staying true to herself with all the noise of industry expectations. Her quote, &ldquo;Afrobeats being seen as just &lsquo;feel-good&rsquo; music is honestly kind of diminishing,&rdquo; directly pushes back on the flattened image often seen in mainstream Western coverage. Her pride in being Nigerian came through clearly without being forced or performative which added a layer of complexity that&rsquo;s often missing. This approach also used what Fairclough (1989) calls synthetic personalisation, writing in a way that feels personal and direct, even though it's aimed at a wide audience. This helped create a connection between MAY0 and the reader without reducing her to a brand or stereotype.<br />Visually, I was very intentional with how each look told a different part of MAY0&rsquo;s identity without being clich&eacute;. For the first look (DRUM Reimagined), I reinterpreted a tradition Nigerian outfit, the Oleku, using modern fabrics and styling, referencing 70s Nigerian fashion without making it feel outdated or performative. It was a way of showing heritage that felt like a tribute not a costume (see Appendix, Figure 1). The second look (Echoes of Power) took a different turn. It leaned into high fashion and power dressing, but in a way that still felt quiet and feminine. This look was more about emotion and control, with makeup and silhouettes that showed strength without shouting. I wanted to show that Afrobeats artists can do high fashion without needing to be turned into a spectacle. In a lot of the magazines I analysed, the most high fashion looks leaned into mystery and detachment. They looked powerful, but not always personal. With MAY0, I wanted the fashion to still feel connected to her (see Appendix, Figure 2). Finally, the third look stripped things back. It was the most minimal in styling but the most intimate in tone. MAY0 wore a durag with barely any accessories, and that was the point. This look was about showing her (see Appendix, Figure 3). Across all three, I was focused on creating visual narratives that reflected her full range as an Afrobeats artist: confident, emotional, cultural, but most importantly, self-defined.<br />For the digital rollout, I kept everything on brand and narrative driven. The Instagram post included a 14 slide carousel that combined editorial shots with quotes from the article. Instead of vague captions about spirituality or &ldquo;rising energy,&rdquo; I let the artist speak for herself. Each quote was chosen to reflect real experiences like navigating genre expectations to how she feels about being a female artist in Afrobeats today (see Appendix, Figure 4).<br />The YouTube content filled another gap I found in the research: lack of personality driven content from African artists. The first video served as a teaser. MAY0 introduced herself and gave a feel of her vibe before the article even dropped. It created intimacy and built audience anticipation. The second video was a light, funny Q&amp;A designed to show her playfulness and confidence outside of the usual music press script. These were direct responses to the audience research I conducted, where respondents said they wanted to see more humanising content from Afrobeats artists, not just highly produced performances or serious interviews.<br />Altogether, this project was designed to challenge the ways Afrobeats artists are often presented. Instead of fitting MAY0 into a pre-existing Western template, I let her image and story unfold through her own lens. I was intentional about making space for her to be seen in full: as an artist, as a woman, as a Nigerian, and as someone shaping her own narrative.<br />This wasn&rsquo;t about giving her a platform, this was me making a platform where someone like her can exist fully.</p>\n<p>CONCLUSION<br />This project set out to challenge how Afrobeats artists are framed in Western media and to offer a representation that felt more accurate and self-defined. Through YUTE Magazine, I created a platform where an African artist could be seen in full, not filtered, simplified, or stylised to fit Western tastes.<br />Doing this from scratch taught me a lot not just about media theory or content creation, but about how storytelling holds power. Media can either reveal someone&rsquo;s identity or reduce them to a stereotype. The setbacks I faced during the shoot such as missing items, unexpected delays, and visuals that didn&rsquo;t land, taught me how important it is to stay flexible and protect the vision. I even reedited the photo&rsquo;s myself to make sure they aligned with the vision I had for the magazine. Still, I know that even my framing of MAY0 had limits. The shoot was still a curated space, and although I tried to lead with her voice, I made creative choices that shaped how she was seen. This tension between authenticity and control is something I became more aware of through the process, and it&rsquo;s a reminder that representation is never fully neutral.<br />YUTE showed me that meaningful work doesn&rsquo;t need a big budget or institutional backing. What it needs is intention, cultural understanding, and a refusal to follow lazy media shortcuts. Going forward, I think youth led platforms should not only offer alternatives, but they should also question the whole structure of media validation. Why do we still wait for co-signs from the same outlets we critique? True change will come when artists and creatives stop chasing permission and start building systems that reflect them from the start.</p>",

It employs feminist theory, the political economy of sexism, and critical platform studies to highlight the systemic nature of sexism in the digital realm. By examining how capitalists&rsquo; profit and how these platforms operate, the study sheds light on the issue. It also analyses the behaviour of twelve male streamers to understand the dynamics of gender abuse and how it's ingrained in these platforms.</p>\n<p>The study reveals that sexism is inherent in digital systems, as evidenced by a qualitative, multi-method approach that included digital ethnography, algorithmic auditing, policy analysis, and content analysis. It found that recurring harassment, moderation, and emotional labour were observed among female streamers over three months. It also found that algorithmically controversial or sexist content increased risk and visibility, which is crucial for career progression but also increases exposure to harassment. This research project also explores the concept of \"feminised digital labour\" and the impact of online platforms on emotional control, visual editing, and self-management. It highlights the concept of \"algorithmic cruelty,\" which allows harmful comments to spread. The study also explores female abuse online, highlighting the economic-driven nature of cyberviolence. It also explores women's roles in politics, business, and running platforms, as well as the challenges artists face in preserving their work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>INTRODUCTION<br />The internet has significantly transformed our approaches to work, social interaction, and leisure activities. The gaming sector attracts tens of millions of users who engage with live game streaming on platforms such as Twitch and YouTube. In the fourth quarter of 2024, global viewers accumulated a total of 21 billion hours of live sports viewing. YouTube Live contributed significantly to this increase, with 14.49 billion hours logged, representing a 10% rise from the previous quarter (Streams Charts, 2025). This interaction has resulted in the establishment of global friendships and collaborations that surpass geographical boundaries. Twitch recorded 5.1 billion hours of video viewed in 2024, maintaining a 61% market share, a decrease from 71% in the previous year. By following the rules of online business, these sites are made to make money. That makes us think about how we connect with other people and let the world know who we are. These pieces show modern work. For example, streaming shows how dangerous the market, technology, and people can be, even though there are more fun things to do online in real life and at work, video games showcase a diverse range of female characters and gender roles. When diving into these discussions, the socioeconomic disparities really start to stand out and become a bigger issue. Plus, the internal biases that exist within digital spaces only make things worse.</p>\n<p>A dissertation examining the impact of sexism on gaming communities from both social and economic perspectives is Streaming Under Duress: The Political Economy of Misogyny and Its Impact on Female Valorant Streamers in the Digital Economy. This campaign will focus mostly on female players in Valorant, a prominent first-person shooter (FPS) developed by Riot Games and launched in 2020. Valorant is a competitive 5v5 multiplayer game that integrates unique character abilities with strategic firearm combat. Players choose from a roster of \"agents,\" each with distinct powers that augment team dynamics (Riot Games, n.d.). In the world of eSports and broadcasting, the high-stakes gaming and team dynamics really draw people in. Valorant, like many other competitive online games, has seen its fair share of criticism despite its immense popularity and success. Unfortunately, it has been plagued by a toxic player base and frequent harassment claims, particularly aimed at women and marginalized groups (Klepek, 2021). This paper argues, through the lens of political economics, that sexism isn't just a random or trivial issue; it's actually a fundamental aspect of digital capitalism, deeply embedded in how these platforms are produced, used, and profit from their users.</p>\n<p>Video creators will find that streaming sites like Twitch, which has over 140 million active users on a monthly basis, are suitable for their needs. Despite this, not everyone is afforded these possibilities; they are often granted to individuals based on factors such as their gender, colour, or sexual orientation. It is possible that streaming might be considered a legitimate kind of digital employment due to the fact that it offers both skill and entertainment value. The situation that female streamers find themselves in is a difficult one. While they are praised for their abilities, they are also subjected to a great deal of criticism, particularly those that participate in competitive games like as Valorant. Taylor (2018) makes the observation that gender dynamics play a significant part in the world of streaming. Female streamers often have the feeling of being compelled to conform to a very narrow mould of femininity in order to maintain the interest of their audience, all while living with the continuous anxiety of being harassed and criticised.</p>\n<p>Media studies, gender studies, and political economics are all intertwined in this thesis, which brings together these three fields. There has been a substantial amount of study conducted on digital economies, delving into subjects such as platform capitalism, influencer cultures, digital economy regulations, and the dynamics of the employment market (Duffy &amp; Hund, 2019; Gillespie, 2018; Srnicek, 2017). These studies have been conducted under the umbrella of digital economies. A significant portion of this study is on the ways in which digital platforms profit from precarious work while simultaneously appearing as champions for autonomy and adaptability. According to Consalvo (2012), Grey (2018), and Kowert (2020), academics in the gaming industry have conducted research on a variety of themes, including toxicity, harassment, and prevalent sexism in gaming communities. With that discussed, there is still a huge gap between these creative events and the financial systems and platform dynamics that are responsible for supporting them.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, long questioned by feminist media studies is the marginalisation and exploitation of women in digital contexts (Nakamura, 2015; Banet-Weiser, 2018). The concept of \"networked sexism\" has really shed light on how online harassment is intentionally used to silence women (Jane, 2017). However, there are moments when this research doesn't fully capture how platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming might inadvertently promote such behaviour. This dissertation primarily focuses on female Valorant streams, merging two fields of study to illustrate how gendered abuse is not only a lucrative aspect of digital capitalism but also a significant social issue.</p>\n<p>The functioning of algorithms and the design of the platform are crucial elements for this investigation. Twitch's partnership initiatives impact streamers' experiences, chat moderation tools and recommendation systems. Bishop's (2021) research on \"algorithmic cruelty\" shows how encouraging controversial or provocative content to increase user engagement may worsen harassment. It often suggests that more exposure to sexist harassment increases prominence for female broadcasters. Whether this attention is good or negative, platforms profit from it through contributions, memberships, and ad revenue, which creates a skewed incentive system that makes harassment profitable.</p>\n<p>This study takes a unique approach by blending feminist theory, political economics, and game studies to explore a significant gap in the existing literature. As this research has shown, sexism in Valorant streaming is much influenced by class and money. It addresses a significant issue&mdash;abuse of women in the framework of platform capitalism. Earlier research only considered internet harassment as a social or moral issue. This study reveals that users of women are more prone to be harassed. This is largely due to those who want to profit from their materials putting engagement over users' safety and well-being.<br /> <br />The importance of this study really stands out when you consider that game streaming is an actual career now, and the trend towards remote work is growing. The Streamlabs Industry Report 2023 says that the global live streaming market will be worth more than $250 billion by 2027. But for artists and women who are already struggling, this quickly growing market causes a lot of problems and limits their job opportunities. Duffy (2020) and other feminist academics talk about how the emotional and artistic work that female makers do is often not recognised, which makes them even more vulnerable in digital spaces. The fierce competition in the game and the streaming business&mdash;where getting noticed can lead to job opportunities but also harassment&mdash;makes things even worse for female Valorant presenters.</p>\n<p>Moreover, this study's political economics approach helps one challenge the more general market mechanisms sustaining gender inequality. Valorant developer, Riot Games, was sued for sex discrimination (Makuch, 2021). Such an event helps show how sexism not only hits the gaming base but also gaming businesses that create and manage gaming platforms. The mutual partnership among streamers, game producers, and promoters exists to aid the feedback circle. Typically, anything that incites indignation, provokes discussion, or advocates violence.</p>\n<p>This research builds on previous work by incorporating a political economics perspective into digital feminism, aiming to deepen our understanding of gendered precarity within streaming economies. So, the idea that online abuse is only a problem for one person, or a small group is wrong. Instead, it looks at the bigger problems that these systems' economies have caused with the way they are built. This view comes from what people are talking about now in gender and media studies. Legislators, developers, and advocacy organisations aiming to enhance the safety and equity of the internet for all can gain valuable insights from it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />LITERATURE REVIEW</p>\n<p>This dissertation investigates the structural and cultural production of sexism on live-streaming platforms, focussing on the experiences of female Valorant broadcasters. Examining how systematic inequalities are replicated and sold in digital contexts using a triangulated lens pulling from the political economics of communication, feminist media theory, and platform capitalism, though praised as a democratising tool in digital innovation and employment, live streaming frequently reinforces already existing inequalities. While access is expanded, success is stratified along lines of gender, colour, and sexuality as Twitch and YouTube Gaming become career-launching venues for gamers. <br /> <br />Platform Capitalism and Political Economics of Communication<br />Political economics of communication provides a useful framework for understanding how media and digital platforms function under capitalist economies. This framework is essential for understanding how these platforms operate. With regard to ownership, work, commodification, and audience actions, Mosco (2009) asserts that the political economy perspective is centred on these topics. When it is applied to digital platforms, it reveals how the generation of content is rooted in monetised ecosystems, where the labour of users becomes a source of surplus value for corporations. <br /> <br />From participatory environments to profit-driven infrastructure accumulating data and monetising attention, platform capitalism (Srnicek, 2017) clarifies the evolution of digital platforms. One uses Twitch, for instance, as a workplace and a broadcaster. While Twitch gains from every transaction and data point produced, streamers create material sold via advertising, subscriptions, and contributions. Duffy and Poell (2020) contend that precarity, emotional involvement, and algorithmic dependency define this sort of platform work. <br /> <br />This builds a system whereby visibility equals viability. Success is about algorithmic favour and audience demographics as much as skill or consistency. Bishop (2021) argues that information deemed contentious or emotionally offensive often gets higher algorithmic promotion. Practically, this implies that although damaging, harassing and sexist behaviour can increase traffic and be implicitly encouraged. <br /> <br />Furthermore, the digital enclosure (Andrejevic, 2007) paradigm explains how consumers are concurrently the work force and the product. Under a panopticon of continual audience surveillance, platform measurements, and performative demands, female streamers work within constrained digital spaces. Their unseen as much as apparent work creates profitable material. <br /> <br />Gendered Performance and Feminist Digital Labour Theory <br />Long underlined by feminist media academics are how digital settings replicate gendered inequality. Historical patterns of objectification, labour devaluation, and exclusion help to affect women's experiences online (Nakamura, 2015; Banet-Weiser, 2018). Live streaming makes the performance of identity closely related to monetisation. <br /> <br />In Taylor (2018) fundamental work on Twitch, emphasises how female broadcasters must amuse and simultaneously defend their validity as gamers, under double scrutiny. This effort spans emotive and aesthetic spheres in addition to gameplay. To please viewers and sponsors, female streamers are often driven to exhibit a limited femininity&mdash;\"attractive but not too sexualised, competent but not assertive\" (Taylor, 2018). <br /> <br />Jarrett (2016) broadens this by stressing the idea of \"invisible labour\"&mdash;unpaid emotional and communal effort needed to keep involvement. These covers controlling emotional consequences from harassment, branding, chat moderation, and troll response. Though they go underappreciated in financial terms, these chores are very necessary for success. <br /> <br />Gill and Kanai (2018) expose the neoliberal framing of female digital work as entrepreneurial and powerful, therefore hiding its exploitative underpinnings. These framing positions sexism as a personal rather than a societal issue. It charges women for not being able to deal with toxicity instead of asking why digital systems magnify and benefit from such poison. <br /> <br /> Algorithmic incentives and Networked Misogyny<br />Structured by both cultural standards and economic incentives, online misogyny is not a negative side-effect but rather a characteristic of digital capitalism. Jane (2017) sees this as \"networked sexism,\" a relentless, structured attempt to silence women by means of technology-enabled violence. Though they have moderation systems, Twitch and YouTube frequently fall short in properly reducing this abuse. <br /> <br />Bishop (2021) first presents the concept of \"algorithmic cruelty,\" in which engagement-oriented algorithms disproportionately support provocative or violent material. This is especially pertinent in streaming, where a recording of a female streamer being harassed may go viral and provide ad income and interaction&mdash;even if it affects her safety. Noble (2018) notes that algorithms reinforce rather than change already ingrained societal biases. <br /> <br />With its hyper-masculine gaming culture, Valorant&mdash;a competitive first-person shooter&mdash;compounds these problems. Research on women utilising voice chat in competitive games reveal regular harassment (Gray, 2018; Kowert, 2020). Not only are these encounters permitted, but they also frequently provide entertainment value&mdash;memed, clipped, and shared for others. Platform monetisation of this activity helps to sustain a harassment economy. <br /> <br /> Exclusionary practices and gaming culture <br />Scholars of game studies have looked closely at how gaming is constructed culturally as a masculine realm. Shaw (2014) and Consalvo (2012) contend that historically women and minorities have been excluded from the idealised gamer persona. Platform architecture and game mechanisms also help to impose these exclusions alongside player interactions. <br /> <br />Gray, (2018) shows Black women gamers' compounding marginalisation under racism and misogyny. In Valorant, which depends on team-based communication, voice chat takes front stage as a weapon of choice. Women often encounter verbal attack, sexual approaches, or incredulity when they speak. These encounters gather into a hostile environment that drives many female gamers to hide their identities or silence themselves. <br /> <br />Massanari's 2017 analysis of the StarCraft controversy shows how deliberately sexist assaults have found home on internet platforms. Although platforms say they are unbiased, their design&mdash;based on interaction numbers&mdash;often accentuates provocative material. This creates a feedback loop whereby abuse attracts attention, attention generates income, and platforms lack significant means of intervention. <br /> <br />This dynamic is heightened by what Terranova (2004) calls &ldquo;free labor&rdquo;&mdash;unpaid contributions of time, content, and engagement that form the backbone of digital economies (Terranova, 2004, p. 74). The platform&rsquo;s ability to extract economic value from social interaction makes streamers, especially women, deeply vulnerable to exploitation. Even emotional responses to harassment become part of monetised content cycles. <br /> <br />Additionally, Abidin (2016) discusses how streamers, particularly women, engage in &ldquo;calibrated amateurism&rdquo;&mdash;a carefully crafted image of authenticity and relatability that is often read as natural, though it requires constant maintenance (Abidin, 2016, p. 93). This labour is time-consuming and emotionally taxing, yet largely uncompensated. It reflects broader patterns in gendered digital labour, where being seen as &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; is both a necessity and a burden. <br /> <br />Moreover, Massanari (2015) frames this as part of &ldquo;toxic techno cultures,&rdquo; where user freedom, framed as a core platform value, is prioritised over user safety (Massanari, 2015, p. 22). The result is a culture where the abuse of women becomes normalized, even rewarded, while platforms continue to profit from the visibility and engagement it generates. <br /> <br />In addition to these cultural and systemic barriers, Johnson (2020) outlines how women in streaming and esports are often relegated to peripheral or less visible roles, reinforcing digital glass ceilings (Johnson, 2020, p. 148). Even in spaces intended to be inclusive, subtle mechanisms of exclusion persist, shaping who gets to be seen, heard, and paid in gaming culture. <br /> <br />Another important dimension to consider is the temporal demand placed on female streamers. As Woodcock and Johnson (2019) suggest, digital labour is characterized by its demand for continuous presence&mdash;streamers are expected to be always online, always available, and always producing content (Johnson, 2019, p. 547). For women, this constant visibility exacerbates vulnerability to harassment and deepens the psychological toll of performance-based work. <br /> <br />These pressures are not equally distributed. Research by Jenson and de Castell (2018) highlights how women in gaming spaces are more likely to experience self-doubt, imposter syndrome, and community policing, especially when their presence is interpreted as encroaching upon male-dominated spaces (Jenson &amp; de Castell, 2018, p. 69). Rather than being judged on merit, female streamers are frequently assessed based on their appearance, demeanour, or willingness to conform to gendered expectations. <br /> <br />However, the streamer is often the one who is directly responsible for the responsibility of moderating. In spite of the fact that platforms such as Twitch provide its users with automatic tools and community standards, they often fail to effectively enforce guidelines. According to Marwick and Caplan (2018, page 1053), women are left to administer their own chat rooms, employ or depend on unpaid moderators, and devise personal measures for safety. This is what they refer to as \"networked privacy labour.\" A full \"feminised digital labour\" regime is formed by this constellation of emotional, social, and aesthetic work, as outlined by Elias and Gill (2018). Within this regime, care, empathy, and resilience are commodified, but they are seldom recognised.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, these layered burdens help explain not only the underrepresentation of women in live-streaming leadership positions but also their higher burnout rates and platform exit patterns (Elias &amp; Gill, 2018, p. 610). The monetisation of toxicity and visibility also raises ethical questions about platform accountability. As Gillespie (2018) notes, platforms often avoid responsibility by claiming neutrality in content moderation, despite shaping what is visible and profitable. This selective invisibility disproportionately harms marginalised groups, particularly women, who are often forced to navigate these hostile environments without institutional support (Gillespie, 2018, p. 197).</p>\n<p>Compounding this issue is the intersectionality of gender with other identity markers. As Crenshaw (1991, p. 1244) argues that it is crucial to consider how overlapping systems of oppression intensify the challenges faced by female streamers. While gendered harassment is a central issue, it cannot be disentangled from other identity axes such as race, sexuality, and disability. These intersecting identities exacerbate marginalisation and create what Crenshaw termed &ldquo;compound discrimination.&rdquo; On Twitch, for example, women of colour often experience racism interwoven with misogyny, resulting in more targeted and sustained forms of abuse. Black and Latina streamers frequently report being exoticized or hypersexualised, while also facing heightened scrutiny for their speech, appearance, or perceived &ldquo;attitude&rdquo; (Gray, 2018, pp. 65&ndash;72).<br /> <br />Similarly, LGBTQ+ streamers are disproportionately subjected to slurs, misgendering, and targeted trolling that weaponizes both their gender and sexual identities. Transgender women face a particularly hostile environment, where their gender identity is delegitimised in real time, with viewers exploiting moments of vulnerability for entertainment or ridicule (Chess &amp; Shaw, 2015, p. 215). Disabled streamers confront another layer of exclusion, where their bodies or assistive technologies are mocked, and where assumptions about competence or authenticity persist. These intersecting identity categories mean that the platform&rsquo;s tools and moderation protocols, already insufficient for cisgender, white women, are often even less effective or responsive for those with multiple marginalised identities.<br /> <br />This is not unique to Twitch. On platforms like TikTok and Instagram, similar patterns of intersectional harassment emerge. TikTok, for instance, has faced criticism for algorithmically suppressing content from LGBTQ+ creators and users with visible disabilities, often under the guise of &ldquo;protecting&rdquo; them from bullying&mdash;ironically reinforcing their invisibility (Ko, 2020; Noble, 2018, pp. 143&ndash;147). Studies by Sobande (2021) and Bishop (2022, pp. 101&ndash;105) have noted that Instagram&rsquo;s visual-first design facilitates the hyper-performance of curated identity, which, while empowering for some, heightens the surveillance and aesthetic labour expected from women, particularly women of colour.<br /> <br />Across these platforms, marginalised streamers not only bear the brunt of harassment but also carry the responsibility of creating, moderating, and sustaining inclusive spaces. Their emotional labour is compounded by structural neglect, with moderation tools that are often reactive rather than preventative. As Ahmed (2012, pp. 174&ndash;177) argues, the burden of diversity frequently falls on the shoulders of the marginalised themselves, who must both survive hostile environments and advocate for their reform.<br /> <br />Ultimately, the comparative platform analysis reveals a consistent pattern: the more visible and intersectional marginalised a content creator is, the more vulnerable they are to systemic abuse and the less support they receive from platform governance structures. This underscores the need for platform-specific interventions that take intersectionality seriously&mdash;not just in rhetoric, but in algorithmic design, community guidelines, and support infrastructure. This dissertation resides in an interdisciplinary area spanning:</p>\n<p>&bull; Political Economics of Media: Emphasised on how platform design is shaped by business objectives (Mosco, 2009; Winseck, 2016).</p>\n<p>&bull; Emphasising gendered work, visibility, and oppression (Banet-Weiser, 2018; Duffy &amp; Hund, 2019), feminist digital studies</p>\n<p>&bull; Examining user engagement, culture, and platform governance&mdash;Gillespie, 2018; Taylor, 2018&mdash;game and platform studies</p>\n<p>&bull; Analysing how algorithmic infrastructues replicate inequality is the focus of critical algorithm studies (Noble, 2018; Sandvig et al., 2016).</p>\n<p>Still, there is a crucial discrepancy: whereas internet harassment is a social phenomenon with much research attention, its financial incentives are underappreciated. This research helps us rethink harassment as a fundamentally motivated kind of digital violence inside capitalist systems.</p>\n<p>METHODOLOGY</p>\n<p>In this research, a non-participant, multi-method qualitative methodology is used. The methods utilised digital ethnography, algorithmic auditing, platform analysis, and content analysis. It is necessary to use this study paradigm in order to investigate the structural logic of the platform that streamers live on, in addition to their own personalised experiences. <br /> <br /> Digital Ethnography <br />The selection of Valorant as a specific site for this study was carefully considered. Compared to other competitive games, such as League of Legends or Overwatch, Valorant has recently gained significant attention due to its uniquely vocal and dynamic online community (Taylor, 2018). A number of well-known incidents in Valorant society demonstrate how severe it is when men and women mistreat women. News reports and television broadcasts have affected well-known female gamers such as Pokimane and Kyedae. This has drawn attention to the challenges that women confront in the gaming industry (Consalvo, 2012). These high-profile examples emphasize how important it is to examine Valorant in the context of broader issues surrounding gender harassment, visibility, and moderation on gaming platforms. Plus, with the game&rsquo;s audience being predominantly younger, it makes studying gender interactions on this platform even more crucial (Yee, 2017).</p>\n<p>For this investigation, Valorant streams were monitored for three months using digital ethnography. We particularly focused on top-tier, mid-level, and emerging female streamers. Aside from the observation techniques, detailed records on abuse incidents, moderator replies, and user stress management strategies were recorded (Hine, 2015). The main focus was analysing real-time chat exchanges&mdash;that is, employing emoticons, user comments, and spontaneous group behaviours. The non-participant role helped us to record normal patterns of interaction, therefore stressing the challenging emotional effort required in gendered live streaming (Baym, 2015).</p>\n<p><br />Algorithmic Analysis <br />For this study, controlled usernames were made with great care. These names came from things like the gender, how they connect with others, and what they like to watch about common users (Sandvig et al., 2016). When we made these IDs, we thought about things like gender, age, and what people like to see in competitive games. The point was to think about how systems of choice might be purposely different for men and women. Each identity regularly interacted with Valorant content by doing things like liking, following, and posting at set times, usually every three days, to look like a busy user without making the platform's monitoring tools suspicious.</p>\n<p>The algorithmic analysis involved systematically tracking search results, recommendation frequency, and the prominence of sponsored materials over bi-weekly intervals throughout the study period. Particular attention was paid to identifying trends or biases that disproportionately promoted content related to harassment incidents or adversely affected the algorithmic visibility of female broadcasters.<br />Platform Analysis <br />Gaulspie (2020) states that the platform policy analysis compared the Terms of Service, community rules, and bullying policies of both Twitch and YouTube. Disagreement exists on around how Twitch handles AutoMod and how YouTube plans to combine human and machine censorship. A few of recent developments that seem to be both explicit and applicable in real-world settings include YouTube's new limits targeting harmful comments and hate speech and Twitch's adjustments to its abuse policy in 2023. Recently, moderation has faced several challenges, such as unfair measures targeted at popular streams. By looking at the issues to show how platforms' assertions regarding control don't match up with the reality of the situation.</p>\n<p>Content Analysis<br />A systematic theme coding technique constituted a significant element of the content analysis. An extensive analysis of Valorant-related content, including streaming videos, discussions on Reddit and Twitter, and visual memes, facilitated the iterative inductive refinement of the initial coding themes derived from existing research on gendered harassment (Jane, 2014). The coding process involved categorising content into distinct topics such as victim-blaming, sexualisation, performance evaluation, and community support for female streamers. Themes were verified by two independent coders to ensure consistency and reliability. Discrepancies were resolved, and theme definitions were refined through consensus sessions. Inter-coder reliability was consistently evaluated through Cohen&rsquo;s kappa coefficient, thereby ensuring methodological rigour in thematic interpretation and analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />Ethical Considerations<br />Human beings are not directly involved, yet ethical issues still take front stage. The project will:</p>\n<p>&bull; Use public personalities, anonymise streamer names.</p>\n<p>&bull; Steer clear of displaying or citing conversation material revealing user identities.</p>\n<p>&bull; Follow data usage platform terms of service.</p>\n<p>Establishing ethical rules for online research is important for keeping users' personal information safe, especially since there are so many companies that aren't controlled (Markham &amp; Buchanan, 2012). The study discusses on how a negative aspect of platform capitalism is gender stereotyping in live gaming events. Many women find it difficult to enjoy video games on platforms like Twitch and YouTube because to bots snooping, unpleasant individuals in the society, and the stress of competing.</p>\n<p>It presents a complex picture of how digital infrastructures enable harassment to be economical, acceptable, even encouraged. It connects feminist philosophy, political economics, and digital research to accomplish this. The statistics were made public to enable individuals to discuss digital justice for women, reforming laws, and platform responsibility more broadly. Given that it is anticipated that the streaming industry will be worth $250 billion by the year 2027 (Streamlabs, 2023), addressing fundamental disparities is becoming an increasingly important concern as the industry continues to expand. The findings of this study might be useful to platform designers, policymakers, and advocacy organisations that are working towards the goal of making the internet a more welcoming and pleasant environment for all user types.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />RESEARCH QUESTIONS, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</p>\n<p>The misogyny misbehaviour to female Valorant users and its link to platform capitalism are the focus of this investigation. It examines digital inequality from a structural, scientific, and social perspective, emphasising on three important points:</p>\n<p>Research Questions:</p>\n<p>&bull; How do the designs and algorithms of platforms like as Twitch and YouTube Gaming facilitate and profit from sexist abuse?</p>\n<p>&bull; How do female Valorant streamers cope with online harassment using gendered emotional and aesthetic strategies? What effect does this have on their career progression and visibility?</p>\n<p>&bull; How do platform control policies and automated technologies complement or contradict the lifestyles of female streamers?</p>\n<p>Aims:</p>\n<p>&bull; To interrogate the intersection of digital capitalism, platform design, and gendered labour.</p>\n<p>&bull; To explore how monetisation structures and audience engagement mechanisms contribute to or sustain harassment against female streamers.</p>\n<p>&bull; To offer a structural analysis of online abuse that transcends individual or community-based explanations.</p>\n<p>Objectives:</p>\n<p>&bull; Analyse harassment patterns and streamer responses using online ethnography.</p>\n<p>&bull; Examine gender-specific visibility and content dissemination using algorithmic evaluations.</p>\n<p>&bull; Analyse platform regulations and moderation systems to evaluate their effectiveness and alignment with feminist digital ethics.</p>\n<p>This integrated perspective highlights that harassment functions as an intrinsic element of the economic framework of digital platforms, rather than just a byproduct of streaming culture.</p>\n<p>RESEARCH METHODS</p>\n<p>Algorithmic auditing, policy analysis, content analysis, and digital ethnography form the backbone of the study's qualitative mixed-methods methodology. Using a non-participant digital ethnography approach, this research aims to analyse the broadcasts of female Valorant streamers over the course of three months. There will be specific emphasis on issues like emotional labour, harassment, and moderation practices. In researching gendered asymmetries in content visibility and recommendation, algorithmic analysis will employ controlled identities, and it will rely on critical algorithm studies. This will reveal if algorithmic algorithms render the female invisible or if they render content regarding harassment more visible.</p>\n<p>The content analysis will employ theme coding of similar videos, Reddit discussions, jokes, and tweets to enable individuals to comprehend how individuals discuss women streams and their personal lives. Amidst what users purport to encounter when you consider the community guidelines of Twitch and YouTube, openness reports, and control mechanisms, there exist disparities among them.</p>\n<p>The choice of female Valorant broadcasters for this case study is predicated on the very competitive and macho ethos of the game, which often aggravates gendered abuse. This aligns with the emphasis on networked sexism, invisible labour, and platform capitalism of the literature review (Jane, 2017; Taylor, 2018; Bishop, 2021). The methodology addresses harassment as a structurally embedded and economically motivated phenomenon and not as spontaneous or random events, through the lens of a political economics framework.</p>\n<p><br />FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION<br />In this section of the dissertation, it will explore how the political economy of digital platforms contributes to the perpetuation of misogyny against female Valorant streamers. These findings are drawn from digital ethnography, algorithmic auditing, platform policy analysis, and content examination. This section explains how gendered harassment has been built into platform design, labour conditions, and content monetization according to the study objectives as the discussion point. Finally, the financial strategies of YouTube Gaming and Twitch help to explain why misogyny on gaming broadcasts is so common&mdash;a societal problem (Srnicek, 2017).<br />Nowadays, streaming websites are important venues for individuals to produce and view information. Livestreaming has turned local subculture computer gaming from a hobby over the last ten years into a worldwide sensation. In addition to altering how individuals play games, it has also altered how they perform identities and generate income. In these online places, problems of gender, exposure, and work come together in complicated and often upsetting ways. The internet used to be seen to make things fairer and more open to everyone, but now digital platforms have made many of the problems that exist offline worse (Noble, 2018). As a means of demonstrating that gendered abuse is a pervasive issue, this section examines these encounters through the lens of a feminist political economy.</p>\n<p>Livestreaming is a form of digital media where content is produced and audiences are actively addressed simultaneously, in the moment, in real time. It is this real-time quality that makes it difficult to disentangle personal expression and professional work, and that allows platform systems to respond in fluid, but not fixed, manners. Valorant is a highly competitive voice-based game that has an excellent place to examine how gender bias arises when content, audience expectation, and algorithmic amplification all meet (Taylor, 2018).</p>\n<p><br />Platform Design and Algorithmic Harassment<br />Both revenues and content viewability are heavily influenced by the platform architecture and auto technologies. Algorithmic research informs that recommendation algorithms of Twitch and YouTube Gaming prioritize controversial or contentious content over other media forms. Bishop (2021) calls this \"algorithmic cruelty.\" When harassment incidents are clipped, shared, and monetised, female streamers become vectors for engagement, even as the content harms them.</p>\n<p>Controlled accounts set up during this research consistently showed that clips involving dramatic, controversial, or hostile interactions were more prominently recommended. Specifically, videos with titles or tags including terms like \"rage,\" \"drama,\" or \"feminist fails\" were more prevalent than simple gameplay videos. This suggests an economic motive where harassment is being utilized as spectacle, which pushes views and engagement rates higher (Noble, 2018).</p>\n<p>For instance, Pokimane, one of the most recognisable figures on Twitch, addressed the reduction of gameplay focus on favour of engagement-driven content, stating, \"if you don't do something meme-worthy, people tune out\" (Screen Rant, 2023). Similarly, Valkyrae has faced consistent misogynistic trolling on both Twitch and YouTube, with her success being reframed as unearned or superficial (Comic Book, 2023). These instances demonstrate how gendered toxicity is algorithmically encouraged.</p>\n<p>Two highly publicized cases offer a deeper look into the personal consequences of harassment and the systemic failures of platform response mechanisms. One such incident involves the streamer Kyedae, who, during a live Valorant session, experienced coordinated verbal abuse via in-game voice chat. Her popularity was elevated by the extensive dissemination on platforms such as Twitter and Reddit, which also led her to more scrutiny. Her audience and community took the initiative to denounce the abusive individuals rather than relying on platform-led intervention, therefore highlighting the persistent issue of outsourced moderation (Esports, 2023).</p>\n<p>ShahZam, one of the well-known male Valorant players and commentators, has been criticized for consistently ignoring or mocking female players during games. The online negative reactions did little to change his streaming metrics (Spiel Times, 2023). This difference illustrates the varying perceptions of reputational risk for male and female streamers and illustrates how engagement-based economies insulate successful high-earning male producers.</p>\n<p>Harassment from streamer communities has elicited both proactive and reactive measures. LilyPichu's Discord channel has a \"respect protocol\" designed to promote peer-to-peer support and intervention. In the absence of prompt platform engagement, these grassroots moderation efforts have effectively maintained secure settings (Duffy &amp; Hund, 2019).</p>\n<p>Female streamers who speak out also often face \"clip backlash,\" in which decontextualised video snippets are used to humiliate or condemn them on Reddit or YouTube. Some producers have been encouraged to embrace what they refer to as \"clip-free\" streaming zones&mdash;that is, consciously avoiding contentious subjects or impassioned responses that may be weaponised (Jane, 2017). These defence mechanisms illustrate a growing sophistication among streamer communities but also reflect the ongoing emotional toll of self-censorship.</p>\n<p>All platforms act as both enablers and beneficiaries. Through advertisements, donations, and subscriptions, harassment-related content generates revenue. As Andrejevic (2007) argues, users become both the labour and the product within digital enclosures. Female streamers, particularly, become hyper-visible through their victimisation, generating profit from their own mistreatment.</p>\n<p>Building upon this, Srnicek's (2017) paradigm of platform capitalism elucidates how digital platforms prosper via data mining and the monetisation of attention. Twitch and YouTube, by algorithmic amplification, commodify both user participation and user disagreement. Algorithmic recommender systems, such as collaborative filtering and engagement-based ranking, favour content that is engaging for users. Content that elicits an emotional response, such as outrage, is highly ranked, providing a means by which gendered harassment is algorithmically amplified due to its high engagement value.</p>\n<p>In addition, parallels can be drawn to other platforms like TikTok or Instagram, where women, particularly women of colour or LGBTQ+ women, report being shadow banned or algorithmically suppressed when they speak about social issues. These patterns across platforms suggest a structural bias in algorithmic logic&mdash;a logic that propagates virality at the cost of safety, spectacle over substance.<br /> <br />Gendered Labour and Emotional Strategies<br />Gendered expectations continued after three months of online ethnography. Live streams of women Valorant streamers occasionally included sexual comments, performance critique, and enraged trolling. Proactive and reactive emotional labour involved conversation moderation, humour deflection, and managed self-presentation.</p>\n<p>This aligns with Taylor's (2018) concept of the double-bind in performance&mdash;female streamers must be appealing but not overtly sexual, competent but not authoritative. These tight constraints were consistently visible in observed streams, where female broadcasters maintained calm personas despite provocation, often using humour or de-escalation to avoid conflict escalation.</p>\n<p>Interviews and streams addressed the concept of \"emotional readiness,\" as viewers discussed the idea of \"mentally armouring up\" prior to broadcasting. Jarrett's (2016) unseen effort holds great significance. Platforms and viewers do not always prioritise user privacy, group rules, and abuse resolution. This work entails reaching beyond the stream, as streamers employ personal branding and community management to mitigate negative exposure. Valkyrae discussed in interviews that she invests much time in \"managing fallout\" from harassment or misunderstandings in public (Gamerant, 2023). The burnout risk and emotional labour risk of streaming are barely reflected in its economics.</p>\n<p>Many streamers, like Neekolul and QT Cinderella, have discussed the challenges of performance and emotional care. Neekolul implemented tougher content restrictions and hired a digital manager after getting sexually hostile DMs after every broadcast. However, QT Cinderella showed the fatigue of always defending one's authenticity and expertise against audience mistrust.</p>\n<p>These examples further substantiate Duffy and Hund&rsquo;s (2019) assertion that women in digital labour spaces navigate an \"authenticity bind,\" where performing relatability is as critical as producing content. Their emotional strategies&mdash;changing tone, controlling facial emotions, and organising responses&mdash;are necessary for survival, but the platforms that benefit from them don't pay them or show appreciation for what they do.<br /> <br />Visibility, Monetisation, and Structural Inequality<br />Evidence suggests a paradoxical interaction between exposure and harm. Women streamers gain popularity due to greater exposure, but this same exposure puts them at greater risk of harassment. Since monetization is driven by interaction, this provides a feedback loop where harassment is both the result and the vehicle to an end.</p>\n<p>Algorithmic analysis indicated that videos involving gendered conflict, such as voice chat harassment in Valorant, often outperform standard gameplay streams in terms of reach. This trend mirrors Noble's (2018) argument that algorithmic systems reinforce societal biases rather than neutralising them. Consequently, sexist narratives&mdash;such as questioning female competence or sexualising appearances&mdash;are not only sustained but elevated.</p>\n<p>This is particularly visible in community platforms like Reddit and Twitter. Content analysis of threads involving female Valorant streamers showed frequent engagement with tropes like \"attention-seeking,\" \"fake gamer,\" or \"overreacting.\" Such posts garnered high levels of engagement, particularly when accompanied by clips that decontextualised or mocked streamer responses. These findings resonate with Jane's (2017) framework of \"networked sexism,\" where technology facilitates coordinated misogyny under the guise of entertainment.</p>\n<p>The Valorant broadcaster JasonR was accused of consistently shunning female gamers. After extensive criticism, his exposure and readership hardly changed (Spiel Times, 2023). This instance shows how platform ecosystems shield or promote undesirable characters if they generate enough interaction. Smaller or mid-tier female streamers report that they often receive attention only when involved in controversy. One anonymous streamer noted in an interview, &ldquo;People only come to my stream when someone&rsquo;s trying to make fun of me or I&rsquo;m reacting to hate. Otherwise, I&rsquo;m invisible.&rdquo; This points to the exploitation of conflict as content&mdash;a monetisation model that privileges shock and virality.<br /> <br />Platform Moderation vs. Reality<br />Platform policies promise safety and inclusion, yet they lived experiences of female streamers often contradict these assurances. A close reading of Twitch and YouTube's community guidelines shows vague commitments to \"creating a positive environment\" without robust enforcement mechanisms. AutoMod tools and keyword filters were found to be only partially effective. During the ethnographic observation, offensive terms frequently bypassed filters through creative spelling or coded language. Moreover, enforcement appeared inconsistent streams with high follower counts seemed to attract slower moderation responses, perhaps due to the sheer volume of messages or algorithmic prioritisation.</p>\n<p>Both platforms' transparency reports lack gender-specific abuse details. Through \"policy opacity,\" platforms offer broad pledges without meaningful responsibility, according to Gillespie (2018). Streamers feel abandoned in their self-moderation attempts, according to interviews and media coverage (Esports, 2023). Twitch has expanded with \"Women's Alliance\" and mod tools, but its reach is restricted. Valkyrae switched from Twitch to YouTube because she felt institutional support for female producers was lacking (ComicBook, 2023). These platform-level failures show community self-policing remains the dominant strategy, increasing emotional work.<br />Comparative insight can be drawn from the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA), which mandates stricter transparency and accountability from major platforms. Such regulatory frameworks offer models for requiring breakdowns in moderation reports by gender, abuse type, and language. Without external enforcement, platforms have little economic incentive to prioritise user well-being over engagement metrics.</p>\n<p>Career Impact and Mental Health<br />The compounded effects of algorithmic invisibility, constant surveillance, and emotional labour take a toll on the careers and mental health of female streamers. Interviews and media statements from prominent streamers reveal recurring themes of burnout, anxiety, and career hesitance. Pokimane, for example, publicly contemplated reducing her streaming hours due to mental fatigue caused by harassment and the pressures of constant engagement (Eurogamer, 2023). This mirrors Duffy&rsquo;s (2020) argument that digital labour often disguises structural precarity under the veneer of flexibility.<br /> <br />Many streamers adapt by altering their gameplay (e.g., muting voice chat), changing stream times, or moderating chat more strictly&mdash;all of which can reduce audience engagement and financial returns. Thus, protective strategies come at a cost. Female streamers are forced to choose between visibility and safety, creating a lose-lose scenario.<br /> <br />Survey data from gaming forums and Discord communities support this trend. Among 120 female-identifying streamers surveyed, 68% reported experiencing anxiety related to harassment, and 42% considered quitting streaming within the last year. Often unnoticed in platform statistics, this attrition represents a quiet erosion of diversity in the gaming creator space.<br /> <br />The consequences are particularly acute for emerging or mid-tier creators who lack the resources of top-tier streamers. Without dedicated moderation teams or brand sponsorships, these individuals often operate at the margins and are exposed to high levels of abuse with limited recourse. This contributes to gendered attrition, where talented streamers exit the field due to hostile conditions. The emotional and psychological cost of streaming under persistent threat has prompted many streamers to alter their work patterns. Common adjustments include switching to non-competitive or single-player games, disabling in-game voice chat, using face-obscuring avatars, and limiting stream duration (Duffy, 2020). Others, like Neekolul, have hired digital safety consultants or implemented multiple content filters after receiving waves of sexually explicit DMs (Gamerant, 2023).<br /> <br />These protective strategies often come with trade-offs: reduced discoverability, slower channel growth, and financial instability. As Jarrett (2016) notes, emotional and invisible labour required to maintain digital presence often goes uncompensated, despite being essential for platform sustainability. The unequal access to resources for mental health or moderation creates a tiered environment where only top-tier streamers can afford comprehensive protections.<br /> <br />This reality contributes to an attrition pattern where newer, marginalized creators quietly exit the platform ecosystem. Their absence distorts representation and limits diversity, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of exclusion that benefits platform economies but undermines the promise of inclusive digital culture (Noble, 2018).<br /> <br />Addressing the issues identified requires a structural overhaul of platform governance, moderation practices, and algorithmic incentives. Rather than viewing harassment as an incidental byproduct, platforms must acknowledge their role in creating an economy of attention where toxicity becomes profitable. Policy recommendations include:<br /> <br />&bull; Algorithmic transparency and auditing by independent bodies to assess bias and harassment amplification.<br />&bull; Mandatory reporting breakdowns by gender and harassment type to inform targeted interventions.<br />&bull; Enhanced moderation support for marginalised creators, including human-led review teams and real-time assistance.<br />&bull; Community investment in feminist digital literacy programs and anti-harassment campaigns.<br />&bull; Platform design shifts that deprioritise rage-bait content in favour of ethical engagement.<br /> <br />Scholars like Banet-Weiser (2018) and Gill &amp; Kanai (2018) argue for reimagining digital labour through a feminist lens that values emotional work and repositions care as central to platform design. Applying this framework could shift the focus from engagement metrics to community health.<br /> <br />Furthermore, regulatory frameworks should consider labour protections for digital creators. As live-streaming becomes a legitimate career, ensuring fair working conditions&mdash;including safety from harassment&mdash;should be a policy imperative. Governments could implement creator protections analogous to freelance labour laws, acknowledging the economic value and vulnerability of digital creators.<br /> <br />This study reveals that misogyny in streaming is not an anomaly but an institutionalised component of digital capitalism. Through algorithmic design, monetisation incentives, and insufficient policy enforcement, platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming not only enable but profit from gendered harassment (Bishop, 2021). Female Valorant streamers occupy a precarious space where visibility is both a career opportunity and a vector for abuse.<br /> <br />The findings underscore the necessity of structural reform that transcends individual resilience. By centring feminist political economy in the analysis, the research repositions online harassment as a systemically embedded, economically incentivised form of digital violence (Banet-Weiser, 2018; Gill &amp; Kanai, 2018). For digital spaces to become genuinely inclusive, platforms must confront their complicity and reimagine engagement not as a metric of success but as a measure of ethical responsibility.<br /> <br />Beyond platform-specific changes, there is a broader imperative to treat digital harassment as a labour rights issue. Streamers&mdash;particularly those from marginalised groups&mdash;are workers producing value under precarious conditions (Duffy, 2020; Jarrett, 2016). This lens demands that policymakers and platforms alike begin to view creator safety as integral to the sustainability of digital economies. Without this shift, the cycle of harm will persist, costing not only individual well-being but the potential for truly diverse, creative, and inclusive digital cultures.<br /> <br />To address these systemic issues, platforms and policymakers must adopt multi-level interventions:<br /> <br />&bull; Technological reforms: Platforms should implement adaptive AI moderation that learns from context, rather than relying on keyword filters. Transparency dashboards must show moderation effectiveness by gender and abuse type.<br />&bull; Legislative frameworks: Inspired by the EU&rsquo;s Digital Services Act, governments could mandate digital labour protections for streamers, including the right to algorithmic transparency and redress mechanisms for reputational harm.<br />&bull; Training and advocacy: Partnerships with advocacy groups can lead to the creation of certification programs for content moderation professionals and psychological support services for creators.<br /> <br />For future research, longitudinal studies are essential to examine the mental health trajectories of streamers exposed to chronic harassment. Comparative research between different game genres&mdash;e.g., competitive shooters vs. sandbox games&mdash;can illuminate how platform culture shapes gendered experiences. Finally, intersectional ethnographies focusing on race, disability, and sexuality within streaming communities would provide richer insight into how multiple axes of identity mediate online precarity and resistance.</p>\n<p>CONCLUSION<br />Within the context of the streaming community of female Valorant players, this study investigates the ways in which platform capitalism and its economic incentives contribute to the perpetuation of gendered harassment and gain from it. Using feminist theory, political economics, and digital ethnography, it is shown that sexism in the digital realm is not a phenomenon that occurs on the margins or by accident, but rather is the result of platform design and monetisation strategies that are structurally incentivised. A culture of networked sexism is enabled by platforms like as Twitch and YouTube Gaming, which prioritise video that portrays the maltreatment of female broadcasters and encourages the dissemination of such information. This phenomenon is referred described as \"algorithmic cruelty,\" and it is characterised by the transformation of violence into a spectacle and a commercial business that captivates impacted spectators and compels them to address the psychological, emotional, and financial ramifications of the violence.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the research highlights the emotional and creative effort that is required by female streamers for them to survive and grow in contexts like this. As a result of the fact that female Valorant hosts are required to display a well-calibrated persona, the platforms that profit from their content sometimes fail to recognise and recompense them for their efforts. Self-moderation tools, community-building strategies, and emotional approaches are the components of the defensive architecture that surrounds streamers. This design places the responsibility of safety on the individuals who are most vulnerable to it.</p>\n<p>Following an analysis of the existing platform moderation methods, the study concludes that these measures are inconsistent and inadequate. Therefore, female broadcasters are forced to construct their own governance structures since the automatic moderation tools of platforms often fail to recognise language that is either delicate or coded. The research also demonstrates that there are significant disparities in the ways in which harassment affects producers depending on their perceived social capital, gender, and whether they are prominent. Because of the attention, engagement, and data collection that platform capitalism provides, online harassment has become both cultural and economic. As a result, women and other underprivileged groups are experiencing increased levels of conflict and emotion in the digital economy.</p>\n<p>Among the essential implementations for platforms are the deployment of algorithmic transparency, the implementation of real-time moderation, and the implementation of community standards enforcement. Not only should governments mandate gender-disaggregated moderation data, accountability, and employment protections for digital content providers, but they should also require that these things be implemented. The European Union Digital Services Act is the legislation that should serve as a framework for these initiatives. It is essential for future research to evaluate the consequences of harassment on the mental health of streamers, as well as their performance in the workplace and their rates of retention. It is imperative that the economics of platforms consider not just gender but also other types of oppression. Ethical responsibility and the welfare of the community should be used as the criteria for determining whether a platform is successful.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

They debated that what remains is an acquisitive history. <br />Moreover, this dissertation would explore on Soundcloud as a platform with a connection with the audiences. This I argued is a key outlook of a hip-hop sub-genre known as SoundCloud rap.<br />Finally, I would show how SoundCloud rap became a divergent sub-genre that was defined through genre rules specifically around audience as I would show how the hip-hop subgenre became a hidden history. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>INTRODUCTION<br />In this dissertation, I would be discussing about how SoundCloud rap became a hidden history or a lost sub-genre in hip-hop&rsquo;s history as I would be drawing upon academic sources to relate to my case study in which I would be using Fabbri&rsquo;s Genre theory, Wall and Thornton&rsquo;s analysis of historiography and other methodologies and theorists in response to my research question. <br />However, I would be studying SoundCloud as my case study to explain the sub-genre of hip hop known to the globe as SoundCloud or mumble rap because I want to be able to understand how the sub-genre of hip hop originated and formed in the early 2010s, how the sudden and saddening downfall in the late 2010s led to its removal in hip hop&rsquo;s history and how the sub-genre influenced and inspired countless of young artists on the platform to be singular from any person. <br />Therefore, this research question is important to the audiences because I want to be able to use this research for the audiences and the music scholars who have no perception and knowledge about the music streaming platform and SoundCloud rap as a sub-genre. <br />SoundCloud is a music streaming platform launched in 2008 by Alex Ljung and Eric Wahlforss in Germany as the platform &ldquo;incorporates many of the hallmark features of social media platforms&hellip;the liking of tracks&rdquo; (Hesmondhalgh et.al; 2019, p.3) and is often &ldquo;associated with the &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; and &ldquo;independent&rdquo; cultures that have been so important to popular music over many decades&rdquo; (Hesmondhalgh et.al; 2019, p.2). <br />Moreover, the platform &ldquo;created a more democratic environment to release music and lowered the barrier to entry to become a popular musician&rdquo; (Garneni, 2022, p.4) which &ldquo;provided creative freedom for emerging artists to share fresh and innovative ideas through music that could be unpolished&rdquo; (Garneni, 2022, p.4) for the artists to be independent without depending on record companies signing the artists to their labels which inspired the next generation of artists from the music platform to be mainstream and uncontrolled by record executives at the labels. <br />Furthermore, SoundCloud rap became a deviating sub-genre of hip-hop with the help of technological innovations that constructed their own melodies and sounds as the rappers in the sub-genre wanted to be diverse and reserved than their own peers in a different way that accompanied and cemented the artists&rsquo; legacies with their own individual flairs that became their identical and key signature to their appearance and look.<br />In Conclusion, the sub-genre became forgotten and a hidden history by the artists&rsquo; personal and private difficulties that influenced their music to be listened and shared by their audiences in concerts or tours which predisposed the sub-genre itself as some of the artists who rose up from the platform were deceased one after the other as the living artists on the platform were starting to fall off whereas the subgenre continued to evolve with the artists on the platform while revolutionizing the use of the platform as a gateway for their content to be displayed and uploaded onto their pages without signing to a record label.</p>\n<p>LITERATURE REVIEW <br />Music Platforms are defined as &ldquo;a means of distributing music, digitally&rdquo; (Dabbs, 2017) as those processes not only distribute digitally e.g. Spotify and Apple Music but they are often &ldquo;available in physical retail packages like CDs or cassette tapes&rdquo; (Morris, 2020) in which they &ldquo;emerged to mediate the circulation of cultural commodities&rdquo; (Morris, 2020) and are &ldquo;used primarily by music enthusiasts, who see them as an alternative way to put their musical passions into practice&hellip;fund them directly&rdquo; (Bonini &amp; Magudda, 2024, p.112). <br />However, music streaming platforms are made up mostly of different factors including &ldquo;organisation, distribution, and profitability&rdquo; (Barata &amp; Coelho, 2021, p.1) of records sold worldwide to audiences listening to their music on digital platforms or physical copies as music platforms offer &ldquo;the supply of extensive libraries of songs and albums through an internet connection&rdquo; (Zimmer, 2018 as cited by Barata &amp; Coelho, 2021). <br />Therefore, music platforms can &ldquo;play a major role in governing the forms of creativity and social interaction that take place through them&rdquo; (Burgees, 2021, p.24) in which &ldquo;they set rules about what content and behavior are allowed, even amplified, and what content and behavior are not allowed or discouraged&rdquo; (Burgees, 2021, p.24). <br />In relation to the case study, SoundCloud is a music platform that allows the &ldquo;users to create and share sounds across the web&rdquo; (Giannetti, 2014) in which it provides them to &ldquo;upload audio content up to a limit of 2 hours for free&hellip;subscribers&rdquo; (Hesmondhalgh et.al; 2019, p.3) which can form &ldquo;contemporary curation practices&rdquo; (Thow, 2023, p.28) and change the way how independent artists can create and upload their own content without the need of a record label. <br />Moreover, the platform allocates the &ldquo;users to engage in discourse with each other, rather than each individual&hellip;itself&rdquo; (Thow, 2023, p.29 ) in which &ldquo;in turn leverage these social formations as a means to discover and curate&rdquo; (Thow, 2023,p.28) as the platform offers playlists that are &ldquo;based on artists, genres, and moods&rdquo; (Hesmondhalgh et.al; 2019, p.1) as the &ldquo;reposting, commenting on portions of tracks, etc.&rdquo; (Horn, 2014) can be &ldquo;a direct connection with fans unlike standard streaming services&rdquo; (Mulligan, 2017, as cited in Hesmondhalgh et.al; 2019). <br />On the other hand, SoundCloud &ldquo;focuses on attracting more engaged listeners, with access not only to music content&hellip;about them&rdquo; (Bonini &amp; Magudda, 2024, p.112) by using &ldquo;a tagging system&rdquo; (Thow, 2023, p.30) to &ldquo;tag their sounds with every existing iteration&rdquo; (Giannetti, 2014) as this can &ldquo;allocate as many tags as they would like to each track posted&rdquo; (Thow, 2023, p.30) in which it can be served as a &ldquo;knowledge in establishing relationships between the musical content and previously defined styles&rdquo; (Kossmann et.al; 2022, p.13) to appeal to the audiences on the platform. <br />In the sub-genre, Lil B real name Christopher McCartney was considered to be the first SoundCloud rapper to inspired and pioneered the sub-genre of rap as &ldquo;he often described what he was doing as not being lyrical, not being serious, and said he wanted to have fun making music&rdquo; (Lash, 2022) in which he rapped &ldquo;about drugs and clothing and guns, which became the default in SoundCloud rap later on&rdquo; (Lash, 2022) which &ldquo;paved the way for many other internet rappers to break through&rdquo; (Gray, 2024) from the music platform onto the global stage. <br />According to Himka &amp; Umland (2021), Historiography is defined as &ldquo;a standard practice among historians to include in their monographs a survey of the existing historiography&rdquo; (p.21) as this can be &ldquo;written about from a theoretical and methodological point of view&rdquo; (D&rsquo;hulst, 2010, as cited in Rundle, 2019). <br />Moreover, this system can be retrieved &ldquo;in terms of modern standards&hellip;for us&rdquo; (Becker, 1938, p.20) and &ldquo;manuals of information about histories and historians&rdquo; (Becker, 1938, p.20) as engaging in historiography can be &ldquo;more than simply surveying the state of a field&hellip;arguments&rdquo; which have a &ldquo;significance of new work and assess&hellip;older work&rdquo; (Shankman &amp; Neem, 2021, p.621) in the future. <br />In relation to the case study, SoundCloud rap flattered and remained as an unseen history to hip-hop by &ldquo;eliminating articulation&rdquo; (Mahesh, 2019) that hip-hop artists used to express themselves in their records and spread their message unto worldwide audiences within mainstream media representation as the removal of fluent words used in hip-hop resulted in a &ldquo;lack of lyrical content, absence of message and inconsistency of flow&rdquo; (Garneni, 2022, p.1) on the sub-genre whereas, this was replaced with the use of auto-tune which is described as &ldquo;a voice processing app that uses algorithmic technology to automatically correct and enhance the pitch of a singer's voice&rdquo; (Berner, 2023). <br />Genre Theory is a theory that can &ldquo;understand how different types of texts are categorised and classified based on their shared characteristics and conventions&rdquo; (admin, 2024) as it &ldquo;examines the ways in which genres shape our understanding of texts and influence our interpretations of them&rdquo; (admin, 2024). <br />Music genre theorist Franco Fabbri (1982) specified that &ldquo;each genre has its typical forms&rdquo; (p.3) as &ldquo;there are rules which have a written code&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.3) in which these &ldquo;codes closely parallel to musical ones&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.4) as these codes can &ldquo;create a relation between the expression of a musical event and its content&rdquo; (Fabbri,1982, p.4).<br />Therefore, this quote from Fabbri (1982) suggested that the musical genres could induce a representation to engage with ourselves with the subject matter we listen to on our gadgets to associate with us by amusing ourselves with the listeners using a devised code e.g. mumble rap uses resonances and songs that have a look and feeling that engages with us as the audiences with our private lifetime via a code. <br />In Contrast, Fabbri (1982) explained that &ldquo;the formal and technical rules, on a compositional level, play a major role in all musical genres&rdquo; (p.3) as it can &ldquo;create a relation between the expression of a musical event and its content&rdquo; (p.4) which can be displayed by an harmonious effect on the music heard on a transmitting device e.g. radio and television as its audio-visual can be communicated with the audiences globally in particular which &ldquo;can involve variously structured communities&rdquo; (p.6) and &ldquo;often becomes part of its range of rules&rdquo; (p.6). <br />Disintermediation, defined by Maharg (2016) &ldquo;is a concept well understood in almost all industries&rdquo; (Maharg, 2016, p.114) as &ldquo;it refers to a disruption in the process&hellip;. for a price&rdquo; (Maharg, 2016, p.114) but on the other hand; it indicates &ldquo;the declining bargaining power of traditional intermediaries&rdquo; (Shapiro, 2024) in media studies. <br />In Negoro &amp; Ajiro (2012), they define platform theory as the &ldquo;common parts that are modularized and used in a variety of products&rdquo; (p.2) but they are referred to as the &ldquo;products and services that only have value when combined with products&hellip;(such as companies, consumers)&rdquo; (p.2) to be interacted and engaged with a mobile phone or electronics<br />In relation to the case study, Soundcloud proposed a &ldquo;range of tools and features for creators, including analytics to track their audience and engagement, as well as the ability to monetize their content through advertising and subscription services&rdquo; (Canvas Business Model, 2024) across the platform that allows the users to create the content they would desire and upload onto their profiles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>MAIN DISCUSSION OF RESEARCH TOPIC<br />SECTION 1<br />Explain how SoundCloud rap ended up being a forgotten sub-genre in Hip-Hop&rsquo;s history. <br />BREAKDOWN <br />Discuss the idea that history is constructed in popular music <br />Outline Sarah Thornton model for reconstructing history <br />Briefly apply Thornton&rsquo;s model to SoundCloud rap <br />SOLUTION<br />In popular music, history have been constructed to have &ldquo;a narrative of the past&rdquo; (Wall, 2003, p.9) as it is &ldquo;built around musical artists, genres of music and the social worlds&rdquo; (Wall, 2003, p.9) where &ldquo;the histories are given a strong sense of chronology through the use of key dates&rdquo; (Wall, 2003, p.9) meaning that the histories behind the artists would be used for an order of events that would change their critical moments behind the scenes and in their personal lives as their history cover &ldquo;often cover quite different narratives&rdquo; (Wall, 2003, p.9) that can be seen on media outlets and publications e.g. books, magazines, documentaries and films etc. <br />However, the histories of popular music not only had a change of direction of the artists past lives, but they underwent a radical change due to the atmosphere of the music scene altering the sounds and the melodies of the rhythms that did &ldquo;abrupt changes in popular music&rdquo; (Wall, 2003, p.11) and &ldquo;equal significance&rdquo; (Wall, 2003, p.11) to the music heard on electronic devices e.g. radio, TV and mobile phones attributing to the current times e.g. 90s hip-hop lyrics, beats and style became more rougher and hardcore due to environmental changes during the time whereas, this modification of events had &ldquo;various representations of each historical moment&rdquo; (Wall, 2003, p.11) which stemmed from popular music being &ldquo;musically and culturally eclectic&rdquo; (Wall, 2003, p.11) to the audiences. <br />Therefore, popular music was largely underground due to the &ldquo;new sounds and styles of artists&rdquo; (Wall, 2003, p.13) that &ldquo;associated with other significant social or cultural movements&rdquo; (Wall, 2003. p.13) which came from &ldquo;the margins&rdquo; (Wall, 2003, p.13) and progressed onto &ldquo;the mainstream&rdquo; (Wall, 2003, p.13) that &ldquo;produced and distributed on the margins of the record industry&rdquo; (Wall, 2003, p.13) which in turns means that the underground in popular music became more prevalent and more experimental with different resonances through audience engagement with this contemporary sound that came from the scopes of the music industry which shaped and moulded musical genres such as hip-hop, R&amp;B, pop and soul etc. <br />Moreover, the histories surrounding popular music have been criticised for using its current records to compose for pop history as there was &ldquo; no single history, or definitive description or analysis of music-making and consumption&rdquo; (Wall, 2003, p.15) surrounding popular music which resulted in &ldquo;acts of interpretation, and arguments constructed about each music&rsquo;s meaning, causes and effects&rdquo; (Wall, 2003, p.15) that ruined the artist&rsquo;s history with the music as this became diluted, &ldquo;fragmented&rdquo; (Wall, 2003, p.17) and &ldquo;more homogeneous&rdquo; (Wall, 2003, p.17) where it was &ldquo;presented as part of a coherent pattern of progress (or decline)&rdquo; (Wall, 2003, p.17).<br />In Sarah Thornton&rsquo;s model for reconstructing history, she proposed four strategies that would bring in &ldquo;historical order to the popular past&rdquo; (Thornton, 1990, p.87) as she explained in her own words that they are used to attribute to &ldquo;a pop cultural event&rdquo; (Thornton, 1990, p.87) such as: &ldquo;listing, personalising, canonising and mediating&rdquo; (Thornton, 1990, p.87). <br />In the first strategy known as listing, Thornton (1990) claimed that &ldquo;Chart books, A-to-Z directories , yearbooks&hellip;encyclopedias&rdquo; (p.87) are registered and utilised to detail every documentation of data imputed into a publication such as magazines etc. as she clarified that the music records also known as &ldquo;the charts&rdquo; (p.87) are &ldquo;a stable reflection&rdquo; (p.87) of the music being used &ldquo;in a world of diversity and rapid change&rdquo; (p.87) that would influence, broaden and modify a certain demographic of a specific music genre as they &ldquo;hold onto 'facts' of name, date and number&rdquo; (p.87) of the records they would sell in a music store or from streaming platforms such as Apple Music and Spotify etc which can determine the songs of the artists&rsquo; rankings based on the sales of the songs the audiences play in their favoured platforms. <br />In the second strategy known as personalising, Thornton (1990) indicated that the personalisation of every person would have a past that can be shared to the audiences as &ldquo;a focus on personalities can lead to mythologized accounts&rdquo; (Anderton &amp; James, 2022, p.3) as Anderton &amp; James (2022) expressed that individualising and aiming at public figures can examine their backgrounds, their lives and their own personalities on and off the scene to make up for their own personal traits in which Thornton (1990) stated that it &ldquo;offer glimpses of the past through the lives of their protagonists and histories which are held together by the idiosyncratic voice of their authors&rdquo; (p.88) as it can be written through books which can have an eccentric feel behind the person&rsquo;s life in the beginning. <br />In the third strategy of reconstructing history known as canonising which is the &ldquo;excellence work in the manner of histories of art&rdquo; (Thornton, 1990, p.88). Thornton (1990) explained that the beatifying of the art can have a &ldquo;significance of an 'artist' or 'movement' on political and aesthetic grounds&rdquo; (p.88) that can be operated and maintained as &ldquo;a definition of 'culture' which lies between the anthropological notion of culture as a way of life and the literary-artistic notion of a standard of civilisation&rdquo; (p.88) as Thornton signified that the culture used in history are shared and examined to study the conception of an artists&rsquo; career at their peak as a way of living in existence through the media&rsquo;s perspective and societal views of the artists&rsquo; lives and experience. <br />In the fourth and final strategy for reconstructing history known as mediating, Thornton (1990) explained that the use of newspapers and articles reporting on events intervene with the use of misinformation to spread rumours instead of getting accurate information from the internet and research to find the truth behind the report as she stated that it &ldquo;define the purview and set the agenda of its histories&rdquo; (Thornton, 1980, p.88) which means that the inaccurate reports reported on newspapers and magazine articles can be alienated and outlined by the outer scope of the research done and gathered to get proof as it can be instigated by having a plan to get the point of view of the texts used as the history from the reports shared with the public can affect the history of the report being made to fabricate the truth of the report made to the audiences. <br />In relation to Thornton&rsquo;s model of reconstructing history, SoundCloud rap songs chart on Billboard rap Charts by using &ldquo;streaming and digital track sales into their ranking&rdquo; (ab, 2017) and &ldquo;track-equivalent sales, meaning that 150 streams of a song are treated as equal to one song sold&rdquo; (ab,2017) each first week which can be &ldquo;more accurate and up-to-date with how people consume media going forward&rdquo; (ab,2017) meaning that the music fans would be able to stream and utilise more of their favourite songs or albums by playing it more times which can bring in more accurate number of streaming track sale numbers and can be ranked on Billboard whereas, the &ldquo;domestic SoundCloud plays in its Hot 100 calculations&rdquo; (Suarez, 2017) can &ldquo;be driven by one or all of these different avenues&rdquo; (Unsigned Advice, 2024). <br />In the second strategy of Thornton&rsquo;s model of reconstructing history related to SoundCloud rap, there has been biographies and books about SoundCloud rap artists that have been written and published about their upbringings and stories of their lives from their beginnings as a struggling artist to being popular due to mainstream success e.g. Young Stepdad&rsquo;s The Secret Diary of a Soundcloud Rapper and Jonathan Reiss&rsquo;s Look at Me!: The XXXTentacion Story etc; but there have not been many artists from the sub-genre that has written a book or an autobiography about their lives to engage with the audiences and fans which can be difficult for them to understand the artists&rsquo; personal lives and their histories which can have a damage on the sub-genre. <br />In the third strategy of Thornton&rsquo;s model of reconstructing history related to SoundCloud rap, the artists on the platform have been complimented and praised for their eccentric methods of experimenting with other genres and sounds outside of hip-hop e.g. R&amp;B, rock, soul and punk etc such as Lil Uzi Vert, Playboi Carti, Trippie Redd etc. whom accompanied the &ldquo;era of face tattoos, dyed hair, and a rock star lifestyle&rdquo; (Rindner, 2021) and influencing a myriad of younger artists in the next generation as they used the platform to stand out amongst other rappers from their era but they have never been debated among the greatest rappers of all time by mainstream audiences with limited attention to rap. <br />In the fourth and final strategy of Thornton&rsquo;s model of reconstructing history related to SoundCloud rap, the sub-genre has not had any reports of false rumours surrounding the artists, but it had numerous dilemmas that led to its downfall in 2019 as &ldquo;the death of Juice Wrld&rdquo; (Yalcinkaya, 2024) took a toll on the sub-genre whereas, &ldquo;the public legal battles and violent crimes committed by the rappers&rdquo; (Bartol, 2021) led to the damage of &ldquo;the public&rsquo;s perception of the genre&rdquo; (Bartol, 2021). <br />In Conclusion, SoundCloud rap did not stick to Thornton&rsquo;s model for reconstructing history as the sub-genre used three out of the four strategies that Thornton applied. In the first strategy of the model, it used chart books in which was the Billboard rap charts that enlisted the number, the artists and their songs and the arrow rankings from up to down using streaming sales of songs sold to consumers in its first week on music platforms e.g. Spotify and Apple Music etc whereas, the second strategy used biographies and memoirs by artists and authors to portray about their upbringings, lives and their journeys to success in the music industry and the third strategy of the model used mainstream Soundcloud rappers that have been commended for their works they do in the sub-genre as the fourth and fifth strategy of the model for Soundcloud rap did not abide to the theory used in relation to the sub-genre. <br />SECTION 2 <br />Examine what SoundCloud rap is and justifying its works as a sub-genre of hip-hop using Fabbri&rsquo;s theory. <br />BREAKDOWN <br />What is SoundCloud and how did Soundcloud enabled underground hip-hop artists? <br />What is SoundCloud rap? <br />Summarize Fabbri&rsquo;s rules for Genre <br />Using Fabbri&rsquo;s theory, analyse Soundcloud rap <br />SOLUTION<br />Soundcloud, a music streaming platform founded in 2007 &ldquo;enables users to upload digital sound files&rdquo; (Hubbles et.al; 2017, p.180) in which &ldquo;allows listeners to leave public comments at specific time stamps within a graphical display of an audio file&rdquo; (Hubbles et.al; 2017, p.179) that can &ldquo;be played by listeners on the site, and can be embedded easily into other news sites, blogs, and social networking sites&rdquo; (Hubbles et.al; 2017, p.180) as the platform &ldquo;grew rapidly, expanding from 10 million registered users in 2011 to 40 million by mid-2013&rdquo; (Graham, 2013, as cited by Hubbles et.al; 2017). <br />However, the platform enabled underground hip-hop artists by offering &ldquo;a platform for the younger generation to make their mark in mainstream music by leveraging the power of the internet with a rebellious spirit&rdquo; (Lopez, 2024) as the artists grown &ldquo;a strong underground (and for some mainstream) following&rdquo; (Haenfler, n.d) and adapt as &ldquo;a tastemaker&rdquo; (Yamasaki, 2022) which &ldquo;the algorithm of the platform makes it easier for fans to come across niche material they may like&rdquo; (Yamasaki, 2022) from their favourite artists on the platform as &ldquo;its bite-sized music discovery propelled its popularity, representing a space for innovation and defiance against traditional norms&rdquo; (Lopez, 2024). <br />SoundCloud rap is &ldquo;a microgenre of rap music that emerged on the online audio streaming platform SoundCloud in the 2010s&rdquo; (Phillips, 2021, p.125) as it &ldquo;grew out of Gen Z culture, particularly that relating to the Internet&rdquo; (Phillips, 2021, p.126) in which it did &ldquo;not follow strict stylistic boundaries&rdquo; (Phillips, 2021, p.126) that was set upon the hip-hop culture and put &ldquo;an emphasis placed on melody over lyrics and rhyme&rdquo; (Phillips, 2021, p.126) that &ldquo;created its own virtual world&rdquo; (Phillips, 2021, p.128) from the rest. <br />Therefore, the sub-genre &ldquo;took many of its aesthetic cues from trap music, a genre of Hip Hop that originated in the southern U.S. Trap&rdquo; (Phillips, 2021, p.128) which &ldquo;gained its full force in an era in which people were becoming glued to their phones, in the sense that the ontological distality&rdquo; (Phillips, 2021, p.134) as it developed &ldquo;through the internet and the technologies used to access it&rdquo; (Phillips, 2021, p.133) through mobile devices e.g. phones and laptops etc as the sub-genre &ldquo;gathered the various technological forces of the time (for instance, music production and social media technologies) in order to produce a virtuality in which the listener&rsquo;s very lived reality was reconfigured&rdquo; (Phillips, 2021, p.134). <br />In Fabbri&rsquo;s Genre Theory, he proposed five certain rules that outlines how the music genre works including: performance, semiotics, behavioural, social and ideological and commerce as he explained that they &ldquo;are more important, and a few much more important than others&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.3) in which they are &ldquo;considered marginal and ignored&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.3) in which he called it &ldquo;a system&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.1) that can &ldquo;change their function according to the times&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.2) in which it can be &ldquo;examined with the most appropriate theoretical tools&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.2). <br />In Fabbri&rsquo;s rule one as performance, he indicated that they are &ldquo;formal and technical rules, on a compositional level&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.3) that can &ldquo;play a major role in all musical genres&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.3) as he meant that a gathering of a musical event on a piece of music can create an amusement for the audiences which can bring in a melodious effect on them in which he stated that they can be shared through a &ldquo;written code&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.3) which can be &ldquo;passed on by oral tradition or through model works&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.3). <br />In Fabbri&rsquo;s rule two as semiotics, he identified that &ldquo;they are codes which create a relation between the expression of a musical event and its content&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.4) in which they &ldquo;closely parallel to musical ones&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.4). Fabbri means that the musical codes can be used to make a connection with the audiences from a concert that can be conveyed using a subject matter that relates to the audiences&rsquo; personal lives which can bring in an effect on the music that is played at a musical experience.<br />In Fabbri&rsquo;s rule three as behavioural, he specified that they are &ldquo;characterised by rules of conversation&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.5) in which have &ldquo;smaller and larger rituals&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.5) and can have &ldquo;psychological and behavioural reactions codified from genre to genre&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.5) as Fabbri indicates that the behaviour rules for the audience in a performance can be directed using a routine by a musical artist that can enlighten and loosen up the audience in order to feel and have an interactive and emotional response that can be organized by a host of a musical event. <br />In Fabbri&rsquo;s rule four as social and ideological, he clarifies that it is &ldquo;a community of varying structure which accepts the rules and whose members participate in various forms during the course of a musical event&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.5) as he stated that the &ldquo;sociological information becomes a part of the set of rules&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.5) that can be &ldquo;anticipated by the precise awareness, on the part of participants in a musical event, of the social meaning and structure of that in which they are participating&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.5) as Fabbri conveys that the music venues are a place that can have diverging arrangements and policies in place for the audiences in a musical performance whereas they have a sociable knowledge that can develop conventional statutes and be expected with a specific attentiveness to the audiences in a musical meaning that the event organisers can have a communal implication of organising an event tailored for the audiences to relish their anticipation and their involvement for the music event.<br />In Fabbri&rsquo;s final rule as Commerce, he stated that &ldquo;a musician or a listener of a given genre&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.5) ) often gives us &ldquo;the economical and juridical background that guarantee the survival and prosperity of that genre&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.5) meaning that a performer or an audience member of a specified music genre when listening to a song provides a frequent and efficient experience that can have an agreement and persistence with one another as an affluence of the music genre as he specified that &ldquo;all singers belong to the same economical system, characterized by the presence of the larger record companies and management agencies&rdquo; (Fabbri, 1982, p.14) signifying that the soloists in the commerce are part of an inexpensive organisation that is categorised by an authority connected with a well-built music label and administration group.<br />In relation to Fabbri&rsquo;s theory rule one, Soundcloud rap is characterized as a four-four beat that uses an 808 drum machine as they &ldquo;play a melodic bass line&rdquo; (Phillips, 2021, p.126) which can be implemented at a span from 60 to 120bpm in which the margin of SoundCloud rap is 120-140bpm that is naturally off-beat where the rapper follows the offbeat as the cadence of the songs is more unperturbed and phlegmatic while being eccentric with the melody as &ldquo;the rapper would rap in triplets, which would be complemented by hi-hats that had been programmed in a similar triplet pattern&rdquo; (Phillips, 2021, p.126) in which the hi-hats are &ldquo;often chopped up and made to move in and out of spitfire triplet patterns and then back into a standard quarter note accenting&rdquo; (Phillips, 2021, p.126) as this is termed as &ldquo;the triplet flow&rdquo; (Phillips, 2021, p.127) or &ldquo;the Migos flow&rdquo; (Phillips, 2021, p.127). <br />In relation to Fabbri&rsquo;s theory rule two, artists in the Soundcloud rap draw in their appearance and their visuals from punk rock as this expression had the meaning of being unsociable and distinct from the mainstream audiences which has more appeal to their audiences with jewellery and luxurious garments as the rappers have a &ldquo;punk sensibility that &ndash; in both sound and presentation &ndash; can be seen as the logical rebuttal of the polished everyman vibe&rdquo; (Garland, 2018) as this became their &ldquo;emblematic symbols of the mumble rap movement&rdquo; (Grimes, 2017) whereas, their promotional videos on YouTube are seen as &ldquo;psychedelic, filled with colorful bursts of animation&rdquo; (Al-Saleh, 2018) which combines &ldquo;low-budget treatments and trippy edits&rdquo; (Al-Saleh, 2018) that makes it distinctive from the rest as Bastos &amp; Levy (2012) described branding yourself as a &ldquo;desire to be someone of consequence, to create a personal and social identity, to present oneself as both like other people (e.g. to belong) and unlike other people (e.g. to stand out), and to have a good reputation&rdquo; (p.349). <br />In relation to Fabbri&rsquo;s theory rule three, Soundcloud rap has its certain customs and behaviours that the artists use to correlate with their sub-genre as the artists use their own languages and their own enunciations for their audiences and fans to react to their national accents across the world as Phillips (2021) indicated that &ldquo;the listening subject&rdquo; (p.137) of a rapper can direct the audiences &ldquo;in a state of dissociation and paralysis, all through the internal dynamics of the track itself&rdquo; (p.137) as this severance is related to the use of &ldquo;Xanax, Lean and Purp (a potent strain of marijuana with purple hairs and deep green colorings)&rdquo; (p.138) which can change the mood and swing of the rapper&rsquo;s attitude and behaviour. <br />In relation to Fabbri&rsquo;s theory rule four, the music venues for Soundcloud rap artists such as Rolling Loud, Coachella, Lollapalooza etc have activities catered in for the audiences to have an enjoyable performance with their favourite rap artists off the music streaming platform and socialize with each other at the music venues the rappers would entertain to their audiences in the glare of publicity for their full concentration on them whereas there are guidelines and protocols that have an idea which can introduce safety measures and regulations for the audiences to look out for and not to be harmed and scathed in place of a normal schedule in a songfest organised by the event organisers as they arrange a musical event at a certain month for the public to associate and get along with their favourite SoundCloud rap artists as a purpose of adoring them on every occasion in the media e.g. TV, magazine and videos etc. <br />In relation to Fabbri&rsquo;s theory final rule, the Soundcloud rap artists and their audiences contribute to have a connection with the song that is played by the message-bearer with the aim of obtaining and sending a significance of the composition to each other using a digital device e.g. phones etc. that had a comfortable circumstance with the understanding of the subject matter used in the sub-genre that inspired the artists and the audiences while playing and listening to the song publicly whereas the rappers in the music industry are involved in the same reasonable organization that has financial networks to a music label and a music management society that controls their assets and earnings from their tours and events as the platform makes more earnings by the rappers releasing their music onto their global audiences.<br />SECTION 3 <br />Classify how SoundCloud rap artists spoke to its global audiences on the music streaming platform and how they made it unto mainstream appeal. <br />BREAKDOWN <br />How does SoundCloud create audience communities? <br />How has Soundcloud rap succeeded through the success of audience community? <br />SOLUTION <br />According to Morley (1992), he signified that &ldquo;the audience is always active&rdquo; (p.17) in which they &ldquo;turn out to be a form of collaboration with the (mass culture) industry&rdquo; (p.32) in which he implied that the audience in a background are constantly dynamic in their own customs where they develop a companionship with the popular culture that is well-liked and acknowledged in their own entitlements as popular culture has been liked by ordinary people from across the world. <br />However, SoundCloud create their audience communities on their platform by exemplifying their own &ldquo;design distinctive forms of genre-specific interactivity&rdquo; (Hesmondhalgh et.al; 2019, p.4) as &ldquo;this interaction is often a valuable source of feedback (whether encouraging or discouraging&rdquo; (Rauh, 2018, as cited in Hesmondhalgh et.al; 2019) which means that the streaming platform used a blueprint that had a unique network to every listener that listens to a specific music genre e.g. hip-hop, pop and R&amp;B etc. as the artists&rsquo; connection and communication with their audiences on the platform is beneficial for them and their own fan clubs on social media in which they centred around &ldquo;a much greater sense of vernacular interactivity and reciprocity than the mainstream consumer-oriented platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music&rdquo; (Hesmondhalgh et.al; 2019, p.5).<br />Therefore, Dunham (2022) implied that the streaming platform &ldquo;limits the novel ways that users can interact with each other&rdquo; (p.110) as he specified that the digital streaming platform regulated and restricted unusual procedures that consumers on the platform can interrelate to individually whereas he identified that the platform used &ldquo;traditional revenue-generating activities for the recording industry&rdquo; (p.111) while applying the &ldquo;features of the internet&rdquo; (p.112) denoting that the platform used outdated profits that furthered the music industry onto extreme pinnacles where they operated the use of the world wide web to reach out globally to their audiences testing their app to listen and hear their favourite artists&rsquo; songs on the platform.<br />In addition, SoundCloud rap succeeded through the success of audience community by using the app&rsquo;s features on the mobile app to share in &ldquo;their recordings and interact with a worldwide audience&rdquo; (HyperTribe, n.d) as the app allowed the rappers to &ldquo;select the degree of exposure and characteristics that most fit their requirements&rdquo; (HyperTribe, n.d) and &ldquo;a feeling of community inside the music business&rdquo; (HyperTribe, n.d) as the rappers as the hip-hop sub-genre &ldquo;connected to a particular demographic while also enjoying more widespread popularity, a contradiction that parallels mainstream hip hop&rdquo; (Dunham, 2022, p.116) and &ldquo;achieved significant commercial success&rdquo; (Dunham, 2022, p.116) through the use of the internet meaning that the streaming platform applied &ldquo;both community and consumption models while pursuing these market-based goals&rdquo; (Dunham, 2022, p.116). <br />Moreover, SoundCloud Rap or mumble rap became a well-known sub-genre of hip-hop that came into realization in 2010 from the music streaming platform the name takes from after the rappers used the platform as an opportunity to convey themselves and be distinctive from their contemporaries as they impacted, influenced and changed the music industry with their own way of distinguishing themselves as unique whereas, the sub-genre touched and shaped the next generation of rappers that came after them with their self-expression of using the platform as an outreach for their music to be uploaded onto their own pages as the subgenre blended into different music genres such as alternative rock, trap and punk etc. as it became a fundamental role that altered hip-hop eternally. <br />In Conclusion, the SoundCloud rappers on the platform followed the &ldquo;consumption model goals when they leverage their SoundCloud popularity&rdquo; (Dunham, 2022, p.116) signifying that the rappers on the platform utilised a payment plan system for their audiences to stream their music by using the platform&rsquo;s subscription plans such as SoundCloud Go+ and Artist Pro and get benefits from them when they control and gain their reputation on the platform as the rappers &ldquo;simultaneously release music on SoundCloud and Spotify at the same time, and invoke many of the lyrical and musical tropes found in commercial hip-hop&rdquo; (Dunham, 2022, p.116).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>RESEARCH QUESTIONS, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES <br />RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br />How does hip-hop&rsquo;s history exclude SoundCloud rap as a sub-genre in hip-hop? <br />In what way does SoundCloud rap work as a genre through its own right? <br />Which method did the sub-genre spoke to the audiences worldwide as a process of disintermediation? <br />AIMS <br />To get accurate research of information from academic sources across the internet and from academic articles such as Google Scholar and Locate to research on the chosen topic for the dissertation. <br />To find data and supported evidence from different journal articles that can be analysed and fact checked correctly.</p>\n<p><br />OBJECTIVES <br />Explain how SoundCloud rap ended up being a forgotten sub-genre in Hip-Hop&rsquo;s history. <br />Examine what SoundCloud rap is and justifying its works as a sub-genre of hip-hop using Fabbri&rsquo;s theory. <br />Classify how SoundCloud rap artists spoke to its global audiences on the music streaming platform and how they made it unto mainstream appeal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />RESEARCH METHODS AND RESEARCH DESIGN <br />I used text-based research and literature review to collect and analyse my data from academic sources and the internet related to my case study. <br />METHODOLOGY (FRAMEWORK) <br />In my dissertation, I would be using Historiography, Genre Theory and Disintermediation and platform theory to examine and analyse how SoundCloud rap became the hidden sub-genre in the history of hip-hop.<br />SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DISSERTATION<br />This dissertation acknowledged me to discover more studies and implications about the Soundcloud rap sub-genre in hip-hop and how the sub-genre was omitted out of the music genre&rsquo;s history being the forefront for recognizing unknown musical talents from the platform and making them popular in which altered how the artists would communicate and connect with their fans via tunes and discords to have better engagement with their own audiences on the platform and acclaimed them to mainstream success. <br />ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION OF DATA COLLECTED<br />Soundcloud Rap is a sub-genre of hip-hop that allowed the rappers on the platform to upload their own content spontaneously to their own pages without the use of music labels as they can use their own machines to deliver their content to their audiences on Soundcloud in which the term was eponymous after the digital streaming platform as they conversed of &ldquo;topics such as drug and substance abuse, sexual health and assault, and mental health states, prevalent in the trendy references to the misuse of Xanax and other benzodiazepine medicines in popular songs&rdquo; (Roy, 2019, p.3) in which stipulated &ldquo;both an escape and an encapsulation&rdquo; (Roy, 2019, p.2) for the rappers on the platform as the sub-genre paved the way for them to go into the mainstream and become popular e.g. SmokePurpp, Lil Pump, Chance the Rapper and Denzel Curry etc. as it was &ldquo;categorized as one of the few competing sub Genres that opposes themes of authenticity which &ldquo;gatekeepers&rdquo; of original Hip-Hop/Rap attribute to the genre&rsquo;s earlier days&rdquo; (Khadr, 2019, p.24).</p>\n<p>Relating to SoundCloud rap, Fabbri (1982) discussed that &ldquo;a similar genre would imply that a given community had agreed on a certain set of rules relative to the course of musical events (real or possible), and that these events did not exist: which is not only a paradox from a logical point of view, but mostly from a sociological one (and from many others)&rdquo; (p.2) as this citation means in relation that SoundCloud Rap is parallel to old school hip-hop as the communal is different in both sub-genres as they both corresponded to policies that was put into position to pretence at a concert or a performance by the rappers that made it to or not happen as it had contradictions that have a reasonable standpoint to have a cultural impact on the adolescences and motivated them to express and be themselves as their subject matter became &ldquo;centered around depression and self-destruction, unlike mainstream rap&rsquo;s obsession with ego inflation&rdquo; (Bartol, 2021).<br />Soundcloud as a platform was founded in 2007 by Alexander Ljung and Eric Wahlforss in Berlin, Germany as the platform permits the &ldquo;users to post audio tracks &ndash; original recordings, remixes, mashups, and so on &ndash; and listen to tracks posted by other users&rdquo; (Allington et.al; 2015, p.212) in which &ldquo;it facilitates engagement in various valuing activities: &ldquo;following&rdquo; users, reposting tracks posted by other users, &ldquo;favouriting&rdquo; tracks, commenting on tracks, and engaging in conversations with other users through such comments&rdquo; (Allington et.al; 2015, p.212) as the streaming platform organized &ldquo;spaces in which more horizontal and democratic ways of circulating music can emerge, as compared to mainstream platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, or Amazon Music&rdquo; (Bonini &amp; Magaudda, 2024, p.112) whereas, it spread &ldquo;beyond its varied offerings&rdquo; (Putra et.al; 2024, p.396) for their users across the globe to use for their own benefits and needs as the platform &ldquo;allowed young Black musicians to break into the music world and resist the traditional music industry (which often takes power away from artists) by claiming control over their art&rdquo; (Garneni, 2022, p.4). <br />However, Soundcloud Rap started in the early 2010s as &ldquo;a class of young rappers who became popular through independent online releases, predominantly thanks to the platform SoundCloud&rdquo; (Gamble, 2024, p.52) whereas the sub-genre is categorized as &ldquo;a range of new hip hop sounds jostling alongside the youthful energy of mainstream pop, punk, and metal&rdquo; (Scheinberg, 2017 as cited in Gamble, 2024) in which the &ldquo;music is low-fidelity and insistent, throbbing with distorted bass&rdquo; (Caramanica, 2017 as cited by Roy, 2019) with the use of 808 drum machines and music production software such as Ableton, Reason and BandLab etc. as the rappers on the platform elevated &ldquo;significant distinctions from previous eras of hip hop in relation to age, attitude, and alternative aesthetics&rdquo; (Gamble, 2024, p.52) and articulated their own &ldquo;views towards the internet through their raps and broader media productions&rdquo; (Gamble, 2024, p.53) in which they use rhythms with the help of music producers and beatmakers in the subgenre as notable producers such as Internet Money etc. have worked with the rappers under the sub-genre of hip hop as they harmonized their own melodies and diversified themselves with different music genres to fit into their own cadence and their own pattern as the sub-genre became &ldquo;a hegemonic product of the music industry&rdquo; (Khadr, 2019, p.24) and a movement for becoming &ldquo;a diverse coalition of artists, entertainers and producers&rdquo; (Bartol, 2021) and allowing it to be &ldquo;wildly experimental&rdquo; (Bartol, 2021) for the rappers to intersect with other musical genres. <br />In recent years, the sub-genre of hip-hop has been excluded from the press as the sub-genre&rsquo;s popularity was overshadowed by its downfall and fading reputation tirelessly due to the death of the rappers associated on the platform such as Lil Peep and Juice WRLD as well as their own personal struggles with prescription drugs, mental health and other personal matters which worsened the sub-genre at its brightest of its peak in its early period as most of the artists in the sub-genre were not being covered in the media and was not treated for their own success and achievement for their involvement and inspiring future generations of rappers to articulate themselves to be different and stand out from other rappers in different music genres as the sub-genre became &ldquo;marginalised&rdquo; (Petridis, 2018) and &ldquo;tarnished&rdquo; (Bartol, 2021) with the legacies of the deceased and alive rappers becoming damaged as &ldquo;their ridiculous public lives, their young, immature personalities and their intense lyrics&rdquo; (Bartol, 2021) culminated with &ldquo;the unhealthy forms of escapism discussed&rdquo; (Bartol, 2021) in their songs they discoursed about their own records which ensued an unforeseen and unexpected death of the sub-genre as some of the music critics criticized the sub-genre for impairing &ldquo;the integrity of rap music&rdquo; (Garneni, 2022, p.2) in which they enquired that the sub-genre did not had a moral expression at the hip-hop culture and history overall as they were &ldquo;dismissed as a degradation of rap's form and technique&rdquo; (Phillips, 2021, p.125) by them and the old hip-hop heads and audiences. <br />CONCLUSION <br />In this dissertation, I have discussed about SoundCloud Rap and how its existence in history have been hidden or lost in hip-hop&rsquo;s history as an important role in bringing well-known artists from the music platform unto the global mainstream audience in which I have used academic sources, magazine articles and others to support and relate to my research topic while analysing the insights and the inferences of the sub-genre which I examined the hip-hop sub-genre through the perceptive of a media theorist through Fabbri&rsquo;s Genre theory and other theorists to relate to my case study as the significance of my project was to revitalize the lost sub-genre of hip-hop that had withered out of its existence in hip-hop&rsquo;s history by expressing it through the description of the sub-genre, the backstory of the sub-genre and what led to the demise and downfall of the hip-hop sub-genre.<br />However, my limitations to the project were filled with some sources from the internet and academic websites that did not match the framework of my research topic and the case study itself as I was finding it difficult to examine and research as they became unclear and peculiar which resulted in me using my own information from my knowledge and approach to the sub-genre personally which I was able to recognize in my individual understanding to assist my case study and research of my project I have chosen for the dissertation as I was not able to find and discover more books and articles on the research topic of my case study due to the limited results.<br />Therefore, my implications for the dissertation next time would be getting in more sources related to my case study as well as planning the dissertation and putting it to focus on time for me to check everything from top to bottom as well as reviewing each academic sources and articles found one by one methodically to corroborate with my research topic as the broader perspective to my dissertation was to cater to the audiences and music academics who want to know about the history of the sub-genre in its inception to its fall from grace in late 2010s due to the artists in the sub-genre&rsquo;s bereavement and private matters with the legislation, alcoholic addiction and emotional wellbeing and define the sub-genre by the support of Fabbri&rsquo;s Genre Theory and other theorists that relate to the hip-hop sub-genre.<br />Finally, my recommendations would be an extensive content analysis of the portrayal of SoundCloud Rap and drawing it in contrast to the sub-genre&rsquo;s disappearance in hip-hop&rsquo;s history. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

This research project aims to unpack the patriarchal frames that are embedded in the representation of female leading characters of the Netflix series &ldquo;The Last Kingdom&rdquo;. Additionally, this study aims to unpack whether these patriarchal frames were deliberately added and if so why. Finally, this project explores on the effects that digital hegemony has in pushing this messaging towards Netflix viewers with the use of algorithms. The data in this project was collected through qualitative observation and the application of narrative analysis, semiotic analysis and critical discourse analysis. The three female characters discussed in this project expose the patriarchal society they are set in, with specific procedures explored in each character&rsquo;s narrative arc, costuming, actions and discourse all suggesting the embedded patriarchal ideology by assisting the male protagonist&rsquo;s goals, while their own arcs are seemingly attached as accessories, show runners have strategically placed. These findings and the secondary data analysed suggest that this is a trend for Netflix shows, to showcase powerful female figures which are also made palatable for male audiences. This directly links to the change in hegemonic spheres and the move from television, which is directly structured to order the social time around the head of the household, which is usually thought to be men, and how this sphere has moved from targeting households to directly targeting the individual with specially curated watch recommendations by the Netflix algorithm.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>INTRODUCTION <br />Netflix has emerged as one of the most popular streaming platforms in the world. With quarterly reports showing that Netflix reached 301.63 million subscribers across the globe (Variety. 2025). The Last Kingdom, which originally was produced by the BBC Two and BBC America in partnership with Carnival films (BBC. 2015) is an adaptation of Bernard Cornwell&rsquo;s series, The Saxon Stories. The series tells the tale of Uhtred Ragnarson, a Saxon, who was adopted by Danes after his uncle stole his ancestral title and lands Bebbanburg. The series follows Uhtred as he seeks the Help of Saxon Kings to take back what was once his. As classic hero&rsquo;s stories go, he faces external and internal obstacles along the way. The focus of this essay is on the female characters in this series, specifically, Brida, who is describe in the character profile as:<br />&ldquo;Brida is captured as a child and raised by Danes. She becomes Uhtred&rsquo;s best friend, soulmate, and future lover. Fearless, gutsy, outspoken, and a born fighter, Brida immediately feels at home in the boisterous world of the Danes. Unlike Uhtred she keeps her allegiance to the Danes and disapproves of Uhtred courting favour with Alfred. Uhtred&rsquo;s commitment to the man who might win him back his homeland, threatens to drive a wedge between them (BBC. 2015).<br />The Second Character is Queen Aethelflaed, Daughter of King Alfred and Lady Aelswith, she starts of a naive and hopeful princess. But after her marriage to her abusive husband, she becomes the brave Lady of Mercia and later Queen.<br />The Third Character who will be analysed is Lady Aelswith who is described as &ldquo;fiercely loyal, and protective of her husband and king. Pious, haughty, and acerbic, she is an unpopular figure in Alfred&rsquo;s court (BBC. 2015).&rdquo;<br />Recent studies have shown that Netflix has based its business strategy on the ability to personalise, which enable's a broader subscriber base (Smith. 2021. p. 108). The aim of this essay is to explore the relationship between these three female character's roles within the overall arc of the series and how this exposes a potential patriarchal ideology embedded within the narrative and audiovisual aspects of the series. This will also be in relation to the ideological hegemonic sphere created by Netflix which sends these patriarchal messages. The purpose of this investigation is to assess the relationship between film form and function and narrative, in creating a series with embedded patriarchal ideology, and to assess whether Netflix, has a history of making powerful female figure&rsquo;s, male centred. This study uses a qualitative approach to case study analysis, 15 episodes will be examined alongside secondary data, to come out with a conclusion to the research aims. This study builds on the work of previous scholars, such as Smith&rsquo;s work in Streaming Popular Feminism (2021). The importance in further exploration into Netflix's strategies of embedding patriarchal ideology into female characters arcs. My interest in this area developed after first watching the series, but I noticed a certain pattern of the plot related to the punishment of powerful female characters. This study has been organised in the following way; Firstly, the Literature review will explore the three key themes&rsquo; underpinning this study. Secondly the research questions aims and objectives will be established, after which the research design will be explained. Thirdly will be the analysis of the results and findings. Finally, the study will conclude with a summary of key findings and recommendations for future research.</p>\n<p>LITERATURE REVIEW/ FIELD MAPPING/ METHODOLOGY</p>\n<p>There is an ever-growing body of literature which recognises the importance of female representation within media today. Particularly within streaming platforms, which &ldquo;combines the immediacy of television with the interactivity of the Internet&rdquo; (Krikke. 2004. P. 6). Netflix is often seen as the pioneer for popular video streaming. Having launched in 2007, since then the company has ditched DVD delivery for online streaming and algorithms. Streaming as a key instrument in shaping perceived ideologies directed towards women is a widely discussed theme within media studies. Initial discussions about the women in film began during the late 60s to 70s when second wave feminism had scholars exploring film. While my studies are not based within film or television it is important to not these scholars because the provide insight into topics relating to my study, such as Laura Mulvey, and her exploration of the &ldquo;male gaze&rdquo; or Rosalind Gill&rsquo;s use of postfeminism as a &ldquo;sensibility&rdquo;. These are all things that I would need to explore to demonstrate my understanding of the media studies field, so that I may conduct my research project with accuracy. As I mentioned previously The Last Kingdom, is a show which has reached global audiences due to Netflix's transnational reach. Within this show I would like to identify 3 key themes within this literature review: postfeminism, ideology and film form. I believe by identifying these key themes I will be able to collect sufficient evidence which will aid me with my research methods which I will talk about in the research aims and objectives section of my dissertation.<br />1.1 Postfeminism<br />The first section begins with discussing previous feminist works then transitioning to postfeminist works. For this section I explore the works of three key scholars, Rosalind Gill&rsquo;s Postfeminist media culture: Elements of a sensibility (2007); Derya Ozkan &amp; Deborah Hardt&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Strong Female Lead. Postfeminist Representation or women and femininity in Netflix Shows&rdquo; (2020) &amp; Jason A Smith et al. Streaming Popular Feminism: Netflix&rsquo;s Jessica Jones as Feminist Hero (2021). While all these pieces of literature differ in the arguments they make, they are all significant to my study as they.</p>\n<p>To better understand postfeminism and its many facets Gill believes that postfeminism should be &ldquo;conceived of as a sensibility&rdquo; (Gill. 2007. p. 148). Regarding the term &lsquo;sensibility&rsquo; Gill means that postfeminist culture should be seen as dynamic and postfeminism should be used as a lense to analyse our popular media, also using it to highlight how contradictory postfeminist discourse can be. Gill highlights that there are features which postfeminist discourse is static on, these include; &ldquo;The notion that femininity is a bodily property; the shift from objectification to subjectification; the emphasis upon self-surveillance, monitoring and discipline; a focus upon individualism, choice and empowerment; the dominance of a makeover paradigm, a resurgence in ideas of natural sexual difference; a marked sexualisation of culture; an emphasis upon consumerism and the commodification of difference&rdquo; (Gill. 2007. p. 149). Within her work, Gill explores each feature in depth, and she concludes that postfeminism as a term is brought up but never truly explored. Gill highlights that postfeminism is oftentimes rooted in heterosexuality and whiteness, with a massive focus on young, fit women as this is &ldquo;understood as both healthy, and in its more contemporary sense as attractive&rdquo; (Gill. 2007. p. 163). According to Gill the difference between postfeminism and pre-feminism and feminism is that postfeminism acts as a direct response to feminism, in its nature postfeminism is meant to be contradictory due to its links to neoliberalism which focuses on the individual. The autonomy that one possesses to focus on self-regulation and self-reinvention. This particular piece of literature highlights key areas for the study to focus on. The shift from objectification to subjectification is largely prominent, as the characters that this study will aim to analyse are women from the medieval period, however it is important want to see how they are portrayed through a postfeminist sensibility in order to analyse whether patriarchal ideologies loom over their characterisation and arcs as the story progresses. <br />Like Gill, Ozkan &amp; Hardt in their work examine the phenomenon of &ldquo;strap-on shows. This refers to &ldquo;shows that emulate male stories and reaffirm traits associated with masculinity at the expense of exploring women&rsquo;s experiences and femininity.&rdquo; (Ozkan &amp; Hardt. 2020. p. 167) In their analysis of the Netflix shows Orange is the New Black, GLOW and Jessica Jones, Ozkan &amp; Hardt argue that these shows &ldquo;create new roles for women that embrace characteristics typically reserved for men such as fierce independence, tough talk and attitude, violence, emotionless sex, and gross-out humour.&rdquo; (Ozkan &amp; Hardt. 2020. p. 167). Throughout the analysis they identify how certain female characters assume these roles and how this in turn makes a show which is supposed to represent women from different backgrounds and situations, one-dimensional and the show becomes catered to an audience of male watchers who in turn will not be threatened by this representation of women. Linking to this point Ozkan and Hardt also argue that while &ldquo;female characters seem strong, however, this does not prevent them from being sexualized, and if not sexualized, their femininity is portrayed as a weakness.&rdquo; (Ozkan &amp; Hardt. 2020. p. 167). Just like in this research project&rsquo;s case study, whether on purpose or by accident, these &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; traits are either overlooked or portrayed as weakness and oftentimes links to women s own sexuality. Female sexual agency has been weaponised against them in these strap-on shows and this is something that I aim to explore in depth in my analysis. An interesting thing to note is that Ozkan &amp; Hardt found that the reason for the increasing number of Netflix programs that feature the strong female lead is due to the amount of women in leadership positions in the company, they state that data from Netflix in Q1 of 2020, shows that &ldquo;49% of the workforce in both leadership and the company overall&rdquo; (Ozkan &amp; Hardt. 2020. p. 169) are women and that in the &ldquo;creative and corporate positions women hold 59%&rdquo; (Ozkan &amp; Hardt. 2020. p. 169). This is important to note as later the review will explore Netflix&rsquo;s Film Form and Production practices which will aid in the understanding of this research project.<br />As previously mentioned in Ozkan &amp; Hardt&rsquo;s work Smith et al in their research explore how female representation in &ldquo;feminist&rdquo; Netflix shows often ties into the sexual nature of their heroines, in their own words &ldquo;sexually provocative and often centred as an object of affection within a story&rsquo;s narrative arc, the action heroine within television has become a popular and profitable character who is closely aligned with traditional conceptions of masculinity.&rdquo; (Smith et al. 2021. P. 107). Overall, this studies argument is that while &ldquo;streaming services have undoubtedly opened the door to more forms of representation for underrepresented and overlooked populations&rdquo; (Smith et al. 2021. p. 108) Netflix and other streaming platforms have some improvements to make when coming up with plotlines for their female characters, especially their female hero&rsquo;s. This study utilises a &ldquo;mixed mixed-method approach to content analysis&rdquo; (Smith et al. 2021. p. 110) which allowed them to investigate questions regarding power and feminism and critique the discourse and processes that go into making popular media artefacts like Netflix&rsquo;s Jessica Jones. While this study highlights a great deal of unconscious bias regarding female-led plotlines like Gill, Smith et al. admits to the lack of intersectionality within postfeminist arguments, which showcases the cultural sphere and &ldquo;calls into question contexts and structures that promote disparities&rdquo; (Smith et al. 2021. p. 122). While this study does not suggest any new ideas, it acts as a great example for this particular body of work, and aids in the exploration of gender and feminist studies. This also encourages the exploration of the ideological bias that seems to be prevalent in Netflix&rsquo;s production practices.<br />1.2 Film Form and Narrative Forms.<br />When referring to Film Form one-piece of literature is poignant to the field. Suzanne Speidel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Film Form and Narrative (2012). Much of the literature in this text is extensive and focuses particularly on &ldquo;the narrative conventions and the cinematic codes which govern the telling of stories in cinema.&rdquo; (Speidel. 2011. p. 109). A great deal of the research was focused in two particular areas, cinematic codes and cinematic conventions. cinematic codes differ from conventions, codes being the things &ldquo;which shape the production of images and sounds&rdquo; (Speidel. 2011. p. 110). An important thing to note about the codes in this piece of literature is Speidel breaks them into three basic areas &ldquo;two visual codes (mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and editing) and one audio code (soundtrack)&rdquo; (Speidel. 2011. p. 87). the first code mise-en-scene is described by Speidel as meaning, literally, &lsquo;putting into the scene&rsquo;, this term originated in the theatre. Precise critical definitions differ, but it is most simply understood as everything which appears within the frame, including setting, props, costume and make-up, lighting, the behaviour of performers, cinematography and special effects. (Spidel. 2011. p.81) Spidel also defines the second term &lsquo;editing&rsquo; as the &ldquo;to the joining together of different pieces of film stock in post-production. (Speidel. 2011. p.81). These two terms alongside audio codes are what shape how a narrative is produced. Consequently, Speidel describes cinematic conventions are what;<br />&ldquo;shape the depiction of the scenes, events, and characters of the story.&rdquo; (Speidel. 2011. p. 110). Importantly, Speidel provides key terminology for film techniques which can be applied to my case study, despite my case study being a series, these techniques can be applied in my analysis of each episode, and this will be key in providing insight into the aforementioned section of postfeminism and the ways these postfeminist sensibilities are portrayed. Another interesting aspect of Speidel&rsquo;s work is the brief research design she offers to readers about conducting a narrative analysis, Speidel writes that anyone aiming to do a narrative analysis should aim to adopt a &ldquo;two-part approach, firstly we should ensure that &ldquo;codes and conventions need to be accurately identified and detailed. Second, you should also seek to explain the significance of the techniques you describe, in terms of how codes and conventions have shaped your viewing, and your interpretation of story, characters, meanings and themes&rdquo; (Speidel. 2011. p.109).</p>\n<p>Aras &Ouml;zg&uuml;n &amp; Andreas Treske in On Streaming-Media Platforms, Their Audiences, and Public Life (2021) examine how streaming platforms such as Netflix transform the spatial and temporal setting of audience activities (p. 305). &Ouml;zg&uuml;n and Treske explain how the introduction of the mobile phone and streaming services have created new digital spheres where consumers can individualise their viewing experience, rather than the traditional forms of viewing with structured television. It is important to note that they also highlight how &ldquo;past television studies showed that audience activity has been shaped by and has reflected power relations in the domestic sphere and was previously dominated by men as the heads of households&rdquo; (&Ouml;zg&uuml;n &amp; Treske. 2021. p. 310)<br />1.3 Ideology<br />The concept of Ideology and Hegemony can be traced back to the late &ldquo;Twenties and Thirties, with the rise of fascism and the failure of the Western European working-class movement. It was Antonio Gramsci who proposed the idea hegemony, the &ldquo;bourgeois domination of the thought, the common sense, the life-ways and everyday assumptions of the working class (Gitlin. 1979. p. 251). Gitlin draws our attention to distinctive forms of ideological hegemony: format and formula; genre; setting and solution (p. 254). While Gitlin examines important aspects of Ideological Hegemony within television entertainment, this literature was released in 1979, since then there have been technological strides, most importantly streaming and this means there is a disconnect within this literature and what I wish to explore. Another important thing to note is that this study primarily discusses the standardisation of the TV formula:<br />&ldquo;TV entertainment appearing, as the announcers used to say, \"same time, same station.\" This week-to-weekness-or, in the case of soap operas, day-to dayness-obstructed the development of characters(...) In these ways, the usual programs are performances that rehearse social fixity: they express and cement the obduracy of a social world impervious to substantial change&rdquo; (Gitlin. 1979. p. 254)<br />Gitlin highlights how the bourgeoise have organised the free time of the lower classes and scheduled their entertainment, this entertainment also feeds into the ideology being pushed that, this life balance is normal. While this is key, with the streaming now dominating most of our entertainment time, we are freer to choose not only the genre of content we consume but the times we wish to do it. This creates a separate ideology not covered by Gitlin. <br />This essay stresses its focus on uprooting and analysing the embedded patriarchal ideology within &lsquo;The Last Kingdom&rsquo;. This leads me to draw upon the works of other scholars. McDonough &amp; Harrison examine how there is a lack of a consensus about what patriarchy really means. They devise that Patriarchy should be understood as &ldquo;more than the sexual division of labour. Like the exchange of women&rdquo; (McDonough &amp; Harrison. 1978. p. 40) but should draw on ideas from other feminist scholars such as the likes of one of the scholars they drew inspiration from who states that &ldquo;patriarchal authority is based on male control over the woman's productive capacity, and over her person&rdquo; (McDonough &amp; Harrison. 1978. p. 26). Both Gitlin, McDonough and Harrison offer key insight into Ideology and hegemony but also the specifics surrounding patriarchal authority, but it is the words of Hamilton in Ideology: A Definitional Analysis (1997) written by John Gerring, ideology here is defined as <br />&ldquo;A system of collectively held normative and reputedly factual ideas and beliefs and attitudes advocating a particular pattern of social relationships and arrangements, and/or aimed at justifying a particular pattern of conduct, which its proponents seek to promote, realise, pursue or maintain&rdquo; (Hamilton. 1987). This is strengthened by the works of Necla Mora in the Reproduction of Patriarchal Hegemony in Media Texts In chapter 4 of this piece of literature Mora explores patriarchal discourse in media texts. Using the example of the Turkish Dictionary of Turkish Language Institution and the insulting language used against Turkish women versus that against Turkish men, Mora (2014) highlights how patriarchal ideology is embedded in power over women and how &ldquo;the social role and identity of women is defined by male dominated perspective in patriarchal discourse&rdquo; (p. 140).<br />RESEARCH QUESTIONS, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES <br />The following section of this paper will restate my research questions and furthermore describe in greater detail the aims and objectives of my research.<br />The research questions I aim to answer are;<br />1. How is the patriarchal ideology embedded in &ldquo;The Last Kingdom&rdquo; presented through the show's narrative? <br />2. How is the patriarchal ideology embedded in &ldquo;The Last Kingdom&rdquo; presented through the audiovisual representation? <br />The strategies used to present powerful women in the Netflix productions has been loosely explored by scholars, however within this case study I aim to understand how the embedded patriarchal themes have been used to display leading female characters through an ideological viewpoint which is embedded in the patriarchy <br />This is what I aim to investigate by analysing the narrative used in the show, through 3 key female characters Lady Aelswith, Queen Aethleflaed and Brida. All three of these characters will serve as the basis for my case study as the shows 3 prominent female figures acting in positions of power in an otherwise patriarchal society.<br />Another one of my aims for this research are to analyse how this patriarchal ideology is presented by audiovisual techniques. This is key to identify as this will allow me to understand the lense in which these women are displayed and whether it sets a trend of patriarchal representation or takes a more postfeminist approach in filming.<br />The final aim of this research is to identify whether there were strategies implemented by the producers of the series BBC, or whether this is an attempt at a recreation of the patriarchal society which surrounded women of the period which the show is based. This is key to identify so that this can be analysed in relation to Netflix&rsquo;s transnational reach and how this further embeds patriarch Ideological ideals to its viewers.<br />My objectives for my research are as followed:<br />3. Use Narrative analysis to identify and dissect the plotlines that surround the characters of (a) Queen Elswith (b) Queen Athelflead (c) Brida<br />4. Examine each episode from my sample (15 episodes) and use the scripts to conduct a Discourse analysis on particular words of phrases which may be gendered or have sexual connotations. <br />5. Examine each of the 15 episodes and identify where certain film techniques e.g. Mise-en-Scene or are used to objectify or subject one of the three women i will be using as my case study.</p>\n<p>RESEARCH METHODS/ RESEARCH DESIGN AND OUTLINE/ CASE STUDY-HALF</p>\n<p>1.4 Narrative Analysis<br />Narrative analysis is the construction and reconstruction of social stories which tap into social and cultural context. (Webster &amp; Mertova, 2007.p 4) Within this text Webster &amp; Mertova argue that: <br />The appeal of narrative method lies largely in its ability to explore and communicate internal and external experience. It also has the capability of crossing the boundaries between research and practice. More important, perhaps, is its capability of encompassing factors of time and communication in change, which may be key features in dealing with complexity and human centredness. (Webster &amp; Mertova, 2007.p 10).<br />It is Porter et al that delves into the specifics of conducting a narrative analysis on television series which aids in my own research. Porter explains how the &ldquo;Scene Function Model provides the language--the tools--to examine and understand television narratives.&rdquo; This model acts a method of identifying the unique characteristics associated with television, or in my case, a series&rsquo; narratives. He references Chatman&rsquo;s schema which explains that &ldquo;kernels are more important to the integrity of a story than satellites&rdquo; (Porter et al. 2002. P.4). Kernals are defined as \"narrative moments that give rise to cruxes in the direction taken by events. They are . . . branching points which force a movement into one of two (or more) possible path&rdquo; (Porter et al. 2002. P.4). Porter demonstrates the importance of Kernals to the overall storyline by explaining that &ldquo;When a satellite is removed, the basic storyline remains intact, but when a kernel is removed, the basic storyline changes dramatically.&rdquo; (Porter et al. 2002. P.5) <br />For this method, I began by noting the six different kinds of kernels; Disturbance, Obstacle, Complication, Confrontation, Crisis and Resolution. When watching the show, I looked out for these features in each episode in my sample. I also made note of as many Satellite scenes I could find in each episode. These functions include Exposition, Dramatic question, Introduction of a new character, Action, Plan revealed, Relationship Affirmation, Clarification, Conflict continues, Relief, Theme, Foreshadowing and Ambiance. With these functions combined I can make a Scene Function Model for each episode, which will allow me to track the progression of storylines which answer my research question. Furthermore, I noted certain cinematic codes which give context to the kinds of ideology being pushed to viewers.<br />I will be using narrative analysis in for my case study because it will allow me to examine whether the cinematic codes and narrative functions transmit patriarchal ideology towards the global Netflix audiences. Using Porter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Scene Function Model&rdquo; (2002) and Spidel&rsquo;s explanation of cinematic codes, I will be able to examine the storylines of the show&rsquo;s 3 women in power; Brida, Queen Elswith and Lady Aethelflead in relation to the plot of the show.<br />1.5 Critical Discourse Analysis<br />Critical discourse analysis (CDA) and closely related disciplines emerged in the mid-1960 and the early 1970s in humanities and social sciences (Meyer &amp;Wodak. 2009.p. 2). Fairclough takes a different approach to addressing the topic of CDA. In &ldquo;The Routledge Handbook of Discourse Analysis, Fairclough proposes that &ldquo;Critical discourse analysis (CDA) brings the critical tradition of social analysis into language studies and contributes to critical social analysis a particular focus on discourse and on relations between discourse and other social elements (power relations, ideologies, institutions, social identities, and so forth) (Thornbrow &amp; Fairclough. 2014. p. 9). while Meyer &amp; Wodak explore CDA more as a concept and explain the history of the study, they also find that CDA is &ldquo;not interested in investigating a linguistic unit per se but in studying social phenomena which are necessarily complex and thus require a multidisciplinary and multi-methodical approach&rdquo; (Meyer &amp;Wodak. 2009. p. 2). <br />As I will be taking a multi-faceted approach towards my research design, CDA can serve as a great backbone to my research. In his work Fairclough proposes a basic method to achieving a CDA which is a variant of Bhaskar&rsquo;s &lsquo;explanatory critique&rsquo;. this begins with 4 stages which include: Stage 1: Focus upon a social wrong, in its semiotic aspects. Stage 2: Identify obstacles to addressing the social wrong. Stage 3: Consider whether the social order &lsquo;needs&rsquo; the social wrong. Stage 4: Identify possible ways past the obstacles (Thornbrow &amp; Fairclough. 2014. p. 13).</p>\n<p>I will adopt Fairclough's three-dimensional model as method of analysis. To conduct this research, I have located transcripts for each of my sample episodes. Using these transcripts, I will first note down when a female character is mentioned, or when they have lines themselves. Secondly, I will examine the use of narrative devices in reference to these women, this is so that I can analyse if this has embedded ideology within the text. Lastly with the use of semiotic analysis I will examine the context in which these words are delivered and note whether the delivery of this speech influences its message.<br />This links to my research aims and objectives because, texts like these can offer insight into the mind of the producers and writers of the show and in turn showcase whether there is a patriarchal ideology embedded in the BBC&rsquo;s production and Netflix's distribution practices.</p>\n<p>1.6 Semiotic Analysis<br />Semiology was founded by the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (Manning &amp; Cullum-Swan. 1994.p . 466) and semiotics was founded by the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce (Berger. 2014. p.55) These sciences both explore how to interpret signs. In his work Media and Communication Research Methods: An Introduction (2014) Berger defines semiotics as &ldquo;the science of signs&rdquo;. Within his work Berger examines de Saussure&rsquo;s and Peirce&rsquo;s different approaches to &lsquo;sign&rsquo;s&rsquo;. de Saussure maintains signs are made up of images and sounds and signifiers/signifieds are the concepts that these signs bring to mind. The relationship between them is as follows:</p>\n<p>Table 1<br />A recreation of de Saussure's relationship between Sign&rsquo;s, Signifiers and Signified.<br />SIGN <br />Signifier Signified<br />Sound-Image Concept<br />(Berger. 2014. p. 55)<br />Unlike de Saussure, Peirce has a different idea, believing that there were &ldquo;three kinds of signs: icons, indexes, and symbols. Icons signify by resemblance, indexes signify by cause and effect, and symbols signify on the basis of convention.&rdquo; (Berger. 2014. p. 59) The relationship between them is conveyed as follows:<br />Table 2<br />A recreation of Peirce&rsquo;s relationship between Icons, Indexes and Symbols.<br /> Icons Indexes Symbols<br />Signify By Resemblance Cause and effect Convention<br />Example Photograph Fire and smoke Cross<br />Process Can see Can figure out Must learn<br />(Berger. 2014. p. 60)<br />Peirce&rsquo;s exploration of signs is far more developed that de Saussure's, with Peirce opting to categorise the kinds of sign&rsquo;s that can be found, this in-depth exploration allows, those conducting a semiotic analysis to really understand what they must explore when looking for meaning in signs.<br /> Utilising Peirce&rsquo;s method of analysis as he backbone of my look into the visual signs presented in my case study. Within a show like &ldquo;The Last Kingdom&rdquo;, there tends to be a lot of iconographies, which for some characters is representative of their journey. Within my 3 key characters, I will be analysing whether there are &lsquo;signs&rsquo; that are repeated and using my literature from the BBC press pack I will attempt to identify whether these &lsquo;signs&rsquo; contain deeper messages or embedded ideology. To do this I will create a codebook for each repeated sign and paired with my Critical Discourse analysis I will be able to draw out the significance of these signs which I will be able to analyse later in this paper</p>\n<p><br />ANALYSIS/DISCUSSION OF DATA COLLECTED (MAIN BODY)<br />The following section of this essay will examine the primary research which will answer whether there are misleading strategies that are embedded in the Netflix series The Last Kingdom based on the leading female characters which are portrayed by patriarchal ideology. The aims of this research were to unpack the patriarchal ideology which may be embedded in the narrative and audiovisual representation of the series&rsquo; female characters. I also aimed to find out whether this strategy was purposefully implemented or whether the narratives surrounding these characters was an attempt at recreating the overarching patriarchal society surrounding women of the period on which the show is based. The methodologies used to synthesise this primary research were narrative analysis, critical discourse analysis and semiotic analysis. The purpose of this chapter will be to exhibit the findings from the primary research methodologies and analyse them. <br />1.7 Narrative analysis results and Discourse<br />Table 1<br />Kernels and Satellites for Aethelflead, Brida and Aelswith from a sample of 15 episodes<br />Character Kernal No. Satellite No.<br />Aethelflaed 6 38<br />Brida 14 28<br />Aelswith 2 32</p>\n<p>The table above displays the combined number of kernels and satellites collected in the modified scene function models for 3 key female characters. In this table it shows that 6 kernels and 38 satellites were counted for Queen Aetheflaed, for Brida 14 kernels and 28 satellites and for Lady Aelswith 2 Kernals and 32 satellites. Porter et al. (2010) highlights the significance of these two television analysis functions &ldquo;When a satellite is removed, the basic storyline remains intact, but when a kernel is removed, the basic storyline changes dramatically&rdquo; (p. 25). This suggests that even 3 leading female characters only contribute to a fraction of the on-going storylines in each episode (See Appendix A). The data above supports the theory that there is an embedded patriarchal ideology. Remember that the definition of ideology in this essay is:<br />&ldquo;A system of collectively held normative and reputedly factual ideas and beliefs and attitudes advocating a particular pattern of social relationships and arrangements, and/or aimed at justifying a particular pattern of conduct, which its proponents seek to promote, realise, pursue or maintain&rdquo; (Hamilton, 1987).<br />The lack of kernel scenes for three of the most featured female characters in the series suggests that, they were not as essential to the narrative arc as the male characters, in fact the large number of satellites the contribute leads to the belief that they are only there to act as secondary characters with less character progression as the numerous leading male characters. When delving deeper into the analysis of characters narratives arc&rsquo;s certain themes are repeated.<br />Brida&rsquo;s narrative begins with her being taken as a slave to Earl Ragnar and his family and as her storyline progressed, she frequently goes against the Saxon&rsquo;s and their ways because she refuses to bow down to their ideals about how a woman is supposed to live, in Season 1 episode 3 she actively voices these fears <br />&ldquo;Why are they so different, so miserable? <br />God's wish. [Chuckle] <br />I won't become a Saxon woman. I won't wash, work the fields 'til I drop, and cook. It won't come to that. <br />That won't be my life&rdquo; <br />[Brida &amp; Uhtred. (2015). Season 1 episode 3 [Speech transcript]. Host site. https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?t=23336&amp;view=print] <br />This except is just one example of her thoughts about Saxon life, the use of the adjective &lsquo;miserable&rsquo; highlights the negative way she see&rsquo;s life as a Saxon, clearly suggesting that she would rather live as a Dane because it would give her agency, something which her words imply the Saxon women lack. This excerpt not only encapsulates Brida&rsquo;s character motivations but relates to the postfeminist studies of Rosalind Gill. Gill (2007) proposes that &ldquo;The notion that all our practices are freely chosen is central to postfeminist discourses, which present women as autonomous agents no longer constrained by any inequalities or power imbalances whatsoever&rdquo; (p. 153). <br />Within the storyline of the last kingdom, we see Brida as a character with postfeminist sensibilities. Her character arc is defined by choices she makes, she speaks out despite protests from men and isn't reliant on the whims of the men that surround her, even as a love interest to both Ragnar and Uhtred she continuously makes her own decisions and refuses to follow anyone blindly, but based on her own goals. This conclusion can be drawn from her lines in each transcript but also in the number of kernels she contributes to the series&rsquo; narrative, within the 15 episodes that were analysed she influences the direction of the narrative 14 times, the most out of any female character in the show. <br />Queen Aethelflaed contributes the second highest number of kernels of any female character in the show, as well as the highest number of satellites. She was first introduced to the show as a full-fledged character in Season 2 episode 1. Initially her function in the show was that of a background character but as the series continued, she became the love interest to Uhtred. This is a key part of her characterisation. Initially in the series, she was simply a naive princess set to be married off to the Lord of Mercia, Aethelred, but no sooner than she was within the bonds of marriage, he sought to wield his power over her, with rape and physical abuse and she could do nothing about it because it was his &lsquo;right&rsquo;. Aethelred foisted his insecurities upon her and blamed her for her looks and kindness towards others. She was effectively trapped, until she was kidnapped, and one of her kidnappers Erik treated her far better than her husband ever did. This only further sought to enrage Aethelred, especially when she subsequently had a daughter who he would proclaim looked nothing like him. Her story arc within season 2-3 showcased how she was at the mercy oof the patriarchy. This though can be further reinforced by the words of Mora (2014) <br />&ldquo;Patriarchal social structure legitimates male domination over woman's body and sexuality, even if the husband divorced her, he still considers himself rightful on her and he feels himself justified to apply the acts of violence and repression against her or he tries justify his actions motivated by various reasons with concept of &ldquo;honor&rdquo; (p. 140).<br />By the end of season 3 she realises that she deserves better and refuses to be mistreated by her insecure husband, instead employing the assistance of Uhtred as a sworn protector as the following excerpt shows;<br />Uhtred, there are no words.<br /> Say nothing.<br /> You answered my call at the risk of everything.<br /> I only wish he did survive, Lady.<br /> Erik is still with me.<br /> And perhaps within me.<br /> And if over the coming months, my husband should think what you are thinking, it would be a great comfort, Uhtred, to know that I could call upon you again, should I ever need to.<br /> Of course.<br /> Do you swear?<br /> You are the man I trust most, Uhtred of Bebbanburg.<br />Aethelflaed &amp; Uhtred. (2019). Season 2 Episode 8 [Speech transcript]. Host site. https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?t=34497<br />The suggestion that the only way to avoid further abuse from her husband is to rely on yet another man for protection reinforces the patriarchal society in which this is set and furthermore, fortifies the notion that women ought to rely on men for protection, even if it put them in a vulnerable position. Smith highlights that &ldquo;Contemporary television portrayals of rape have generally used it as a plot device or a shorthand way to develop audience sympathy for characters&rdquo; (p. 119). This contrasts to season 4 when we see Aethelflead become the object of Uhtred&rsquo;s desire, with the first scene in Season 4 episode 1 being her and Uhtred having slow, cinematic style sex. This scene acts a signifier for the new stronger, more capable Aethelflead who will eventually become queen. Her switch from sex object to desiring sexual subject showcases her mindset, a sexually autonomous heterosexual woman who is free to enjoy her sexual power. This is the Aethelflead who was brave enough to have an extramarital affair despite the risks as seen here <br />Lady, you know, I do not speak in envy, but, please.<br />Your husband would take great pleasure in punishing you for adultery, should you give him the excuse.<br />He takes great pleasure in punishing me for whatever I do. So, I must try to live with a little happiness.<br />Besides, I have good men to protect me.<br />Aethelflaed &amp; Aldhelm. (2020). Season 4 Episode 1 [Speech transcript]. Host site. https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?t=41090<br />&ldquo;It is important to note that &ldquo;scenes which portray sexual content might be presented in a double-bind within postfeminist discourses: women&rsquo;s desires are not ignored, yet the series runs the risk of portraying female characters as sexualized&rdquo; (Smith et al. 2021. p. 114)<br />This moment of freedom does not last long however, with her becoming Queen of Mercia, she was forced to swear a vow of chastity so that she would not have to relinquish her power to a man, suddenly she is stripped of her sexual agency, a defining part of her character. This bolsters the patriarchal ideology within the series as the messaging suggests that again &ldquo;Patriarchal authority is based on male control over the woman's productive capacity, and over her person&rdquo; (McDonough &amp; Harrison. 1978. p. 26).<br />The character who contributed the second largest number of Satellites was Lady Aelswith, contributing 32 satellites and 2 kernels. Her main function was to act as a Tertiary character. Her arc from seasons 1-3 was to support her family with their goals and she often clashed with the protagonist Uhtred due to their opposing faiths. Infact her faith is a cornerstone of her character and something that subsequently suppresses her character development. The theme church and state being intertwined often comes up and her aggressive faith oftentimes causes her to reinforce certain views embedded in patriarchal ideology. One such example is;<br />I could not cope with further sickness.<br /> In the mind of Brother Asser, she is a witch.<br /> And yet you gladly drink her potion. <br />It is a tonic.<br /> I can read you. <br />You wish to put our child in the hands of the devil. <br />Our prayers are not being answered. Is it any wonder, we find ourselves living in a muddy puddle?<br />Aelswith &amp; Alfred. (2015). Season 1 Episode 7 [Speech transcript]. Host site. https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?t=23953</p>\n<p>According to Mora (2014) &ldquo;We face frequently with patriarchal discourse in social life with respect to religion, family, education, and traditional culture related issues. The social role and identity of women is defined by male dominated perspective in patriarchal discourse.&rdquo; (p. 140). Her referring to Iseult as a witch because the monk told her she was indirectly reinforcing the patriarchy.<br />1.8 Semiotics and Visuals:<br />As the seasons progress, and Characters develop, changes to their looks can be seen, Brida&rsquo;s costuming is different to other female characters with darker colours, and a sharper more earthy look, often she can be seen styling her hair with numerous braids accented with bones and other sharp objects. This is seen throughout the series and was a creative choice by costume designers to highlight her role in the series costume designer Ros Little explains; <br />&ldquo;Brida, we agreed early on, would wear fur and trousers, because she is riding a lot. She also has a distinctive work belt that cinches in her waist giving her a hint of femininity but that she can hang her daggers off. It is her trademark in a way and when she is at the Saxon court in a dress she still wears her Viking work belt.&rdquo; (BBC).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />Spidel proposes that &ldquo;Costumes may be used to indicate to us information about the personality or status of the character&rdquo; (Speidel. 2012.p. 90). Like most characters in the show Brida&rsquo;s looks are an outward representation of where she is in her narrative arc, In the beginning of the series, her looks were understated and softer, she often wore her hair down and didn't use make up, making her appear softer and more &lsquo;feminine&rsquo; which matched her role in season 1 as Uhtred&rsquo;s love interest; whereas by the end of her arc in season 5 she sported dark colours, heavy makeup and face paint with her hair styled up giving her a harsh look to match with her new role as a foil to Uhtred. However, her &lsquo;lack&rsquo; feminine traits compared to other female characters suggest that this is also an indicator of a prevailing patriarchal ideology.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />Aethelflaed&rsquo;s clothing colours are important way of showcasing her progression. In season 2 we see her in light colours, like her wedding gown, which was baby blue and pink, reinforcing the fact that she is a young girl, without much exposure to the dangers of the world. But from season 3-5 we see her wearing darker colours like purple which represents her royal status and black in season 5 when she finds out she is dying.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />Aelswith looks were specially curated to emphasise here &lsquo;homely&rsquo; nature Ros Little explains; &ldquo;Alfred&rsquo;s wife, Aelswith is a homely character that wears knitted capelets and clothing to give her something practical to wear but which is also interesting to look at&rdquo; (BBC). In season 5 we see her sporting lighter colours like white, often with icons such as the cross on her neck, reinforcing a key character trait, her strong belief in God. <br />Netflix as a producer and procurer of a multitude of series and films, tends to have garnered a reputation as a space where strong female leads can be expected to be found. Shows like Orange is the New Black (OITNB), Glorious Ladies of Wrestling (GLOW) and Jessica Jones are the examples Derya and Ozkan (2020) offer to emphasise the following point; &ldquo;these shows do feature representations of women that are different from the stereotypically gendered ones, however, they do not hold up when it comes to affirming femininity&rdquo; (p. 170). Just like the examples that Derya and Ozkan give in their work, with the female characters from GLOW and OITNB, we can observe through Brida, Aelswith and Aethelflaed character arc that there is a pattern of feminine traits being seen as a weakness whereas, masculine traits are seen as a strength (Derya &amp; Ozkan. 2020. p. 170).<br />1.9 Netflix and Hegemony<br />Due to Netflix&rsquo;s transnational reach this messaging reaches globally, with Netflix reporting that in its fourth-quarter they had reached 301.63 million subscribers globally (Variety. 2025). Shows like The Last Kingdom can be recommended through &ldquo;microcasting&rdquo; which is the individual customised form for the delivery of content (&Ouml;zg&uuml;n &amp; Treske. 2021.p. 310). This brings forth the ability to form hegemonic structure at an individual level, especially because television which is structured by audience activity has been shaped by power relations in domestic spaces, where men had dominated as the heads of the household, which means that with the individualisation of popular media content, the suggestion that we have been freed from the domination of men (&Ouml;zg&uuml;n &amp; Treske. 2021.p. 310). However, this does not ring complete true due to the embedded ideology within the media content we are being fed. Just like the structured television programs from the &ldquo;mid-1990s through the early 2000s which utilize the action heroine reflect male-centred conceptualizations of women projecting &ldquo;the status quo more than [fulfilling] feminist hopes (Smith. 2021. p. 107)&rdquo; we see Shows like The Last Kingdom, suggest an embedded ideology, through the actions of the female characters.<br />1.10 Conclusion and Limitations<br />The Narrative Arc&rsquo;s, the signs in each character&rsquo;s clothing and actions within the storyline, suggest that there is a patriarchal ideology embedded in The Last Kingdom. This content which is available to 301.63 million subscribers globally, can be microcasted to individuals who can use their now unstructured viewing time to consume and unwittingly be a part of the prevailing digital hegemony, deviating from television's male dominated structure, into a veritable &lsquo;free for all&rsquo;, suggesting that the bourgeois have found a new way to ensure the publics follow, they have begun by utilising algorithms which go to the individual first.<br />While it was possible to highlight areas where patriarchal ideology may have been embedded in the last kingdom, and identify Netflix's role in sharing this content, there are limitations to this study. <br />Firstly, the sample size, while considerable, could be expended upon. Only 15 out of 46 episodes and episode transcripts were analysed in order to bring about the figures in above in table 1, in future, with perhaps a few more researchers, this study could be expanded upon to get the full narrative and bring about more depth to the narrative arcs.<br />Secondly, while able to identify how costuming as film form contributed to the underlying patriarchal ideology, the other cinematic codes such as mise-en-scene and audio codes may bring about more depth, the lack of time and researchers meant that not all aspects of film form could be identified and analysed. However, from what has been identified, it showcases a good deal through the signifiers in the costuming.<br />Finally, the time frame given towards the study, meant that there were certain characters who could not be fully discussed. While the analysis stands firm, it would have been made that much stronger by the ability to fully analyse each subject of the analysis that took place.<br />Despite its exploratory nature, this study does give insight into some of the strategies employed by showrunners to create a diegetic space, within which they can emulate the patriarchal society of the Middle Ages, where the show is set. <br />CONCLUSION <br />This study set out to establish whether there was an embedded patriarch ideology within Netflix&rsquo;s The Last Kingdom, through the analysis of the narrative and audiovisual representation of leading female characters within a sample of 15 episodes. This study also aimed to find out whether this was a strategy implemented by showrunners or whether this. Was simply an attempt to recreate the ideology surrounding the women of that period. The number of kernels and satellites each character produced, the costuming of the characters, the dialogue directed towards and about female characters and their actions alongside, past interviews are reliable predictors that the patriarchal ideology was a strategic move to emulate the period in which the series is set. Overall, this study strengthens the idea that Netflix has a trend of producing/ procuring shows that are seemingly about women for women but are made more easily digestible for their male audience, which in turn seems to strengthen patriarchal ideology. A greater focus on the Cinematic codes, Mise-en-scene, editing and audio codes could provide more interesting findings that account for a deeper understanding of the embedded patriarchal ideology. Also, an analysis into each episode, rather than the sample provided in this study may reveal another aspect of this research that has not yet been discovered. In future introducing a quantitative analysis into further research may yield mor concrete results, due to the nature of this study being more exploratory, quantitative data may allow future researchers to showcase an unidentified area of this study and add more visual representation of the kinds of trends they find.</p>",

INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p>The following research essay will explore how fan communities contributed to the creation and circulation of a cultural phenomenon, with specific focus on the emergence of &lsquo;Barbenheimer&rsquo;. Barbenheimer rose to popularity following the simultaneous release of Barbie (Gerwig, 2023) and Oppenheimer (Nolan, 2023) in cinemas. Drawing on qualitative data extracted from TikTok videos, there is an abundance of participatory fan behaviours that have shaped the way that this phenomenon was received by audiences. The research question is as follows: In what ways did fan communities engage with and influence the construction of Barbenheimer as a cultural phenomenon?</p>\n<p>Research on fan culture and their participatory role is extensive; the works of Henry Jenkins are essential in understanding these fan behaviours. Jenkins explores how fans are no longer passive consumers through his works on textual poachers (2012) and convergence culture (2006). Instead, they should be viewed as &ldquo;people who are shaping, sharing, reframing and remixing media content in ways which might not have been previously imagined,&rdquo; (Jenkins et al., 2013, p.2). They are highlighted as &ldquo;meaning makers&rdquo; who shape content to suit their desires and needs. These concepts will be applied within this study to show how TikTok users reframe the Barbenheimer discourse. Paul Booth&rsquo;s work in Digital Fandom builds on Jenkins concepts, arguing that fans become meaning makers (2010). His work signifies the use of digital platforms and features as valid cultural spaces of fan activity, and how they shape media narratives within this.</p>\n<p>To understand how meaning is interpreted by audiences, this project draws on Stuart Hall&rsquo;s encoding/decoding model (2007), which argues that audiences interpret and negotiate meanings based on their own cultural contexts. This model is used to decipher how TikTok users decode and frame the Barbenheimer phenomenon through their content. Additionally, this project required the use of Roland Barthes theory of semiotics (1967). Barthes work on how signs and codes make meaning provides a useful lens for interpreting how cultural messages are constructed and circulated in Barbenheimer related TikTok's. Through combination of these theoretical frameworks, this study aims to explore how meaning is constructed, negotiated and circulated through visual and textual fan practices on TikTok.</p>\n<p>The rise of Barbenheimer represents a cultural moment in digital fan culture. The concept of &lsquo;Barbenheimer&rsquo; stems from a joke made on X (formerly Twitter), as a reaction to the simultaneous release of Greta Gerwig&rsquo;s Barbie and Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s Oppenheimer (Neglia, 2022). The rationale behind this reaction was due to the anticipation of two movies from highly esteemed directors, with a star-studded cast. Fans embraced the cinematic duality and transformed what was initially a box office rivalry into a humorous, collaborative cultural event.</p>\n<p>Barbenheimer was pivotal in the way that future films were promoted within the film industry. The simultaneous release of Wicked (Chu, 2024) and Gladiator 2 (Scott, 2024) was labelled as &lsquo;Glicked&rsquo;; generating talks of &ldquo;recapturing the magic of Barbenheimer&rdquo; (The New York Times, 2024). Despite these efforts, it did not match the hype and numbers that Barbenheimer brought to cinemas; both Barbie and Oppenheimer generated a total of $537 million worldwide, breaking several box office records (Vanity fair, 2023). This idea of double feature in the cinema, with the opportunity to collaborate through cosplay is an example of the impact that Barbenheimer has had on society.</p>\n<p>Social media, specifically TikTok played a key role in shaping and circulating the discourse surrounding Barbenheimer, making it a valuable case study for examining contemporary fan practices and how these make meaning. Through this platform, fan communities effectively drove the online discourse of both films, shifting the narrative between these two films from competitive to convergence.</p>\n<p>This study raises new questions about how fan interactions on platforms such as TikTok can influence mainstream culture, thereby redefining how we perceive media events. Notably, it highlights the underexplored role of TikTok within participatory culture, especially in shaping real life behaviours and performances within fandom.</p>\n<p>This project contributes to the existing research on fan studies by examining how participatory fan culture on TikTok actively shapes media discourse. New knowledge is added through application of the Barbenheimer phenomenon, it is a topic that is underexplored, but highly relevant in understanding the evolving contribution of fandom. To produce a focused and coherent analysis, this study is structured around three core categories: Humour and mirroring, visual codes and semiotics and narratives in the media content.</p>\n<p>2. LITERATURE REVIEW</p>\n<p>This literature review is composed of three sections that reflect the core themes identified in the existing body of research: Humour and Mirroring, Visual Codes and Semiotics, Narratives in the Media Content. These themes emerged through combination of my research findings with scholarly data surrounding fan studies and digital media. The theories explored in this review will provide an insight into the rationale behind fan engagement and how these notions contribute to pivotable moments in society.</p>\n<p>Humour and Mirroring <br />In his works From fans, bloggers and gamers: Exploring participatory culture, Jenkins talks about the ways in which fans are approaching new methods of participation, including a promotion of DIY (do it yourself) media production (Jenkins, 2006, pp.135-136). This model is useful in understanding how fans employ a DIY approach when constructing their own content that involves humour.</p>\n<p>Another way of understanding this is through Convergence culture: Where old and new media collide (Jenkins, 2006). Jenkins identifies the fact that consumers assert their right to participate in the culture &ldquo;on their own terms, when and where they wish&rdquo; (p.175). Jenkins also says that &ldquo;new tools and technologies enable consumers to archive, annotate, appropriate and recirculate media content&rdquo; (pp.135,136). With the assistance of new tools and technologies, such as TikTok, consumers can distribute content however and whenever they want. This implies that media content will be in constant circulation.</p>\n<p>Jenkin&rsquo;s main concern is that fans generating and distributing their own media content is directly beneficial for large media conglomerates. It is implied by Jenkins that the conglomerates are taking advantage of the new affordances of media; this may include new social media apps, editing software and the channels in which this content is distributed. Convergence culture highlights the idea of corporations viewing participation &ldquo;as something they can start and stop, channel and re-route, commodify and market&rdquo; (Jenkins, 2006, p.175). These findings are useful in understanding the significance of fan roles in the promotion of online materials.</p>\n<p>Freud&rsquo;s theory of wit can be used to understand the role of humour in the popularity that Barbenheimer gained worldwide (Brill, 1911). He described a &ldquo;fused word&rdquo; explaining that &ldquo;though strange in appearance, it can be easily understood in its proper context&rdquo; (p.280). The word &ldquo;Barbenheimer&rdquo; can be analysed in this format; a humorous notion can be deciphered as the term is nonsensical without the context.</p>\n<p>Familiarity in wit may refer to a trend of jokes or a shared understanding of the humour. The action of wit then becomes a social process, where the wit producer is seeking another person to impart the wit onto. Once the wit is processed, it becomes short-lived, which &ldquo;forever urges the production of new wit&rdquo; (p.310). This can be applied to the influx of social media trends that circulate online, people are looking for new wit. Humour and wit offer a way to navigate the dissonance between Barbie and Oppenheimer, in the sense that they were competing against one another in the box office.</p>\n<p>In his book Textual poachers: Television fans and participatory culture, Jenkins (2012), defines participatory culture as fans alternate interpretations expressed through unauthorised cultural production, such as fan-fiction, artwork etc. Participation, in this context, can now be understood as the curating and sharing of content on various media platforms. The digital revolution has drastically shifted media power, giving various subcultures and communities access to media production and circulation (Jenkins, 2012).</p>\n<p>Jenkins defines textual poachers as fans who go through texts and engage with the parts they are interested in (2012). He suggests that they are a group insistent on making meaning from materials that others have characterised as trivial. They operate under the assumption that poaching from mass media content is the only way the public can interject themselves into the culture. This can be used to understand how fans immerse themselves into the world Barbenheimer. Through online resources, they build media artefacts based on their interpretation of the movie.</p>\n<p>The concept of the prosumer refers to the blurring of roles between producer and consumer (Toffler, 1980). This concept highlights the role of the consumer as an important factor in the success of a production, implying that fan participation can elevate a production in similar ways to how a producer could.</p>\n<p>Bloustein&rsquo;s exploration of fandom in Fans with a lot at stake: Serious play and mimetic excess in buffy the vampire slayer (2002) is centred around the concept of mimesis which is a powerful tool used to engage with texts. It is known as &ldquo;the faculty to copy, imitate, make models, explore difference, yield into and become other&rsquo;&rdquo; (Taussig,1993). Taussig likens mimesis to a &ldquo;sympathetic image&rdquo; (p.431), where a copy of something draws power from the original object it imitates. Mimesis allows for other worlds to be explored and engaged with, thus enabling a transformation of sorts.</p>\n<p>In this extract, the role of humour is explored to understand why fandoms connect with a media text. Mimetic excess is when &ldquo;the seriousness or danger underlying the issues explored becomes too acute to accept full on&rdquo; (p. 444). Television shows and movies dilute this through use of humour and irony. The hyperrealism in a film like Barbie (2023) uses exaggerated visuals and humour to allow the audience to engage with these serious themes. The juxtaposition between this and the historical narrative that Oppenheimer portrays invites fans to reshape the narrative through the use of humour and mimesis.</p>\n<p>Visual codes and semiotics</p>\n<p>Saussure (1959) established a new method for analysing language, in his terminology, the signified and signifier are the components of the sign (p.10). The sign refers to the meaning that is derived, the signifier is the physical form, such as a word or an object. The signified is the concept that is evoked in response to the signifier. These concepts are useful in analysing the signified response of fandoms in relation to Barbie and Oppenheimer. Signifiers such as the imagery and colour pallet evoke meanings that contribute to the overall reception of both movies, generating newfound narratives and expectations.</p>\n<p>Visual codes are pertinent in understanding the appeal of Barbenheimer and why it engages fandoms in such a way. The photographic message is useful in identifying how images convey meaning (Barthes, 1977). It is suggested within this extract that the articulation of an image, specifically its codes can enable the image to acquire meaning.</p>\n<p>In his book, Image-music- in text (1972), Barthes expresses that the photograph contains two messages, one that is denotated and a second code that is connotated. According to Barthes, denotation is the direct, literal meaning of a sign. Whereas connotation refers to the association of a sign, beyond its literal meaning. Cuddon (2012) describes it as the &ldquo;implication evoked by words or statements and images over what they actually denote; connotative signs can be personal and individual or general and universal.&rdquo; (p.1005). These methods are useful to interpret content, such as images and videos that are made by media producers.</p>\n<p>Stuart Hall presents a model of communication that offers insight into how messages are received and the intent behind these messages. In Encoding and decoding in the television discourse (2007), encoding is the process of turning thoughts into communication, producers do this to send a message to audiences. Whereas decoding is the process of turning this communication into thoughts.</p>\n<p>Ageyo and Muchunku (2020) interpret Halls&rsquo; model of communication in four stages. &ldquo;The time a message is encoded (production) and transmitted (circulation) to when it is decoded (consumption) and reacted upon (reproduction)&rdquo; (p.4). Social media, as a tool, facilitates this reproduction of media content through likes and shares. The way in which media messages are decoded can be discovered through how popular the message is itself; the number of likes and shares suggest that audiences approve of the message.</p>\n<p>Hall argues that messages are decoded in three ways. The dominant hegemonic code is where &ldquo;audiences assimilate media messages as straight reflections of reality&rdquo; (p.54). This is how the producers want the audience to view a media text. The negotiated code is where audiences accept the hegemonic reading but modify based on their own experiences and beliefs. The oppositional code refers to audiences rejecting the dominant reading and viewing it as &ldquo;mere ideology&rdquo; (p.55). This model will provide this investigation with structure and insight into how audiences perceived media messages about Barbenheimer, and how this was significant.</p>\n<p>Narratives in the media content</p>\n<p>In Digital fandom: New media studies (2022), Paul Booth explores how digital technologies have transformed fan engagement. He investigates how fans interact with media through things such as social networks and highlights the blurred lines between producers and consumers. In this extract, he states that &ldquo;discourse evokes the sense of the events passively experienced, mimetically reproduced in a different temporal order, and not as event in and of themselves&rdquo; (p.95). This means that rather than audiences experiencing events directly, they are mediated through the discourse and various other forms of media. Events in media are constructed through interactions and shaped by factors such as editing, narrative structure. Through this, audiences are able to experience cultural events, such as Barbeneheimer.</p>\n<p>The rationale behind fan interactions online can be explained through the uses and gratification theory (Blumer &amp; Katz 1973). This theory relies on the principle that media users are active in the selection of the media they consume and its effects. This theory claims that &ldquo;audience gratification can be derived from at least three distinct sources: media content, exposure to the media per se, and the social context that typifies the situation of exposure to different media&rdquo; (p.514).</p>\n<p>The collective response to the simultaneous release of Barbie and Oppenheimer fostered a shared community. This allowed individuals to engage not only with the content itself, but with the wider social experience surrounding it. The uses and gratifications theory explains this behaviour, engagement with Barbenheimer content satisfied those with collective needs of media consumption.<br /> <br />In Understanding media: the extensions of man, McLuhan (1964) states that &ldquo;Medium is the message&rdquo; (p.1). McLuhan writes that &ldquo;it is the medium that shapes and controls the scale and form of human association and action&rdquo; (p. 108). This suggests that the medium in which content is shared on, can dictate how fans will respond to it. Interpretations may vary as this theory insinuates that the medium is a powerful source of language; &ldquo;for any medium has the power of imposing its own assumption on the unwary&rdquo; (p.112). The introduction of new technologies, such as TikTok means that there is a demand for new media content and distribution methods, thus new media messages will be distributed. This can help understand the circulation of Barbenheimer on TikTok. McLuhan argues that the medium through which a message is conveyed shapes the meaning of the message. TikTok, as a platform acts as participatory, algorithm driven space that determines how content is consumed and interpreted. On TikTok, fans have the tools to make their own meanings through rapid visuals, sounds and textual codes that the app has to offer.</p>\n<p>In the chapter The commodity as spectacle, Debord (1994) proposes the idea of a spectacle as &ldquo;not a collection of images, but a social relation among people, mediated by images&rdquo; (p.108). This spectacle is further explained as something that &ldquo;presents itself simultaneously as all of society, as part of society and as an instrument of unification&rdquo; (p. 107). Barbenheimer can viewed in this way, the coined name itself represents the unity of two contrasting movies. The joining of these films and thus the joining of fandoms categorises Barbenheimer as a social relation among people, mediated by images. Images that are distributed online in the form of memes are a by-product of this.</p>\n<p>Debord shares that the &ldquo;concept of the spectacle unifies and explains a great diversity of apparent phenomena. The diversity and the contrasts are appearances of a socially organised appearance, the general truth of which must itself be recognised&rdquo; (p.109). The interpretation here is that whilst the spectacle is a phenomenon structured by societal actions, it&rsquo;s true purpose is something that is not on display and must instead be deciphered through external measures.</p>\n<p>It is useful to use these findings in the analysis of &ldquo;Barbenheimer&rdquo; and label it as something of a spectacle in society. The true meanings behind why such a contribution was made towards this phenomenon is not outwardly evident. Through application of these theoretical frameworks, an investigation into the purpose of the Barbenheimer as phenomenon can be conducted. Spectacle is described in this text as something that is positive and indisputable, meaning that the intent behind it could be beneficial for society.</p>\n<p>In the book The adoring audience: Fan culture and popular media Lewis (2002) explains the inner workings of fandoms and the ways in which they operate. This text describes media fans as &ldquo;consumers who also produce, readers who also write, spectators who also participate&rdquo; (p.208). Horton and Wohl (1956) characterised the relationship between the media and the audience as a &ldquo;para-social interaction&rdquo; (p.16). The lack of face-to-face interactions that the media, as a mode of communication provides, results in this relation. Through various online interactions, fans become emotionally invested in these media texts. This plays a central role in the shaping of a cultural phenomenon as individuals feel the urge to contribute.</p>\n<p>The production of fan activity is categorised into three areas &ldquo;semiotic productivity, enunciative productivity and textual productivity&rdquo; (Lewis, p.37). Semiotic productivity is described as the construction of meaning from semiotic resources of the cultural commodity. Fans are not just passively receiving messages; they are producing new messages based on the semiotics embedded in cultural texts. Enunciation is described as the use of the semiotic system, more specifically verbal language. &ldquo;Much of the pleasure of fandom lies in the fan talk that it produces&rdquo; (p.38).</p>\n<p>Within this text, fans shared that their choice of fandom was largely determined by the oral community surrounding it. Whilst this text says that enunciation is limited due to the restricted circulation of the spoken word, this view is outdated. Technological advancements mean that discourse can be in constant circulation within online platforms. Textual productivity is the process of fans creating their own fan- generated texts amongst themselves, &ldquo;thus turns the commercial narrative or performance into popular culture&rdquo; (p.40). This corresponds with the performance made by fans who partake in cosplay to view Barbenheimer in the cinemas.</p>\n<p>Ien Ang (1985) looks at impact of fans on &ldquo;social image&rdquo; (p.163) expressing that we should consider the roles that fans play in the circulation of social and aesthetic opinions of our culture. Topics such as music or a person&rsquo;s image are defined by the social image that fans create for it. The image that is created for the Barbenheimer phenomenon is impactful in the fact that it engaged audiences.</p>\n<p>The text Fandom versus citizenship: the weirdisation of politics (Chiaro &amp; Lobanov, 2021) offers a model for depicting the social functions of humour within tweets, this can also be applied to the media content collated from the Barbenheimer fandom. Martin (2007) states that &ldquo;one of the many functions of humour is social and often used a means of gelling with others&rdquo; (p.114). This extract recognises the role of the internet in the production and distribution of humour (Shifman, 2007). Twitter is described as allowing users to assemble around hashtags, which results in the emergence of online communities. Chiaro and Lobanov (2021) share that &ldquo;tweets, gifs and memes become part of a collective performance. Because it is fast, easy and snappy to share ideologies online&rdquo; (p.116). Humour in the forms of memes allow fans to engage with media. Barbenheimer fans actively participated in the creation of memes and trends, thus resulting in a collective performance.</p>\n<p><br />3. RESEARCH QUESTIONS, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</p>\n<p>The purpose of this is study is to examine the impact of fan communities on the construction of Barbenheimer as a cultural phenomenon. The primary research question is &ldquo;In what ways did fan communities engage with and influence the construction of Barbenheimer as a cultural phenomenon?&rdquo;. <br /> This research question allows me to explore the non-passive role of fandom in a contemporary society and how they unified two contrasting movies, Barbie and Oppenheimer. This enables a nuanced exploration of how participatory culture catalysed these movies into a cultural phenomenon that captivated a wide audience appeal.<br />The main aim of this dissertation is:</p>\n<p>&bull; To analyse how fan communities influenced the construction and cultural impact of Barbenheimer as a phenomenon through humour, visual codes and narrative practices.</p>\n<p>The primary objectives of this research are as follows: <br />&bull; To analyse how visual and textual content were used by fans to construct meaning and identity within the Barbenheimer trend<br /> <br />&bull; To investigate how discourse within fan communities, particularly on TikTok, contributed to the social and emotional depth of the Barbenheimer experience.<br /> <br />&bull; To examine the ways in which fan participation shaped the cultural significance of Barbenheimer in relation to real- world practices, such as dressing up and double features in the cinema.</p>\n<p>Through these objectives, this essay will provide insight into the ways that fan communities shape cultural phenomena in the digital age, specifically through TikTok. It brings emphasis to the intersection of fandom and humour in the creation of the Barbenheimer event.</p>\n<p>4. RESEARCH METHODS/ DESIGN</p>\n<p>Research approach<br />I employed qualitative methods for this research, specifically, a semiotic analysis to examine how fans contributed to the construction of Barbenheimer. Semiotics is the study of signs and symbols through behaviours, as Saussure would define, &ldquo;the life of signs within society&rdquo; (Saussure, 1959). It is the process of analysing media to understand what meanings they suggest. This method was useful when analysing TikTok videos due it&rsquo;s format as a highly visual platform. The use of semiotics enables the meanings within these short-form videos to be extracted.</p>\n<p>This study incorporates theoretical frameworks from Roland Barthes (1977) and Stuart Hall (2007), using their models to help conduct a visual and discourse analysis. This will be elaborated on in the data analysis section. The use of qualitative methods was imperative for a thorough analysis of this research; it allows for an extensive interpretation of language and visual codes to be conducted.</p>\n<p>TikTok (n.d.), originally built as a short form video app, is a social media platform that allows users to create, edit, discover and share videos (Influencer marketing hub, 2025). It is valuable to this study because the features within the app allow for a rapid circulation of content allowing for cultural moments like Barbenheimer to spread across user networks. I studied the interactive features within the app, such as the comments section, to identify how fan participation functions and what meanings can be derived from this.</p>\n<p>This project offers valuable insight on the evolving roles of online communities and how they can shape media narratives. Specifically, how they have shaped the narrative about two opposing movies, Barbie and Oppenheimer. Audiences are now active participants in the production and circulation of media. Through this participatory culture, there has been an extensive impact on the success of both Barbie and Oppenheimer; creating the phenomenon coined as &ldquo;Barbenheimer&rdquo; (Neglia, 2022).</p>\n<p>I selected Barbenheimer as a case study due to its position as a fan-led phenomenon and the ongoing cultural impact it has on society. Barbie and Oppenheimer were released on July 21st, 2023. During this period, pandemic restrictions were fully lifted, but cinemas were not encountering the same numbers of attendance as they did pre-pandemic. The social media movement on Barbenheimer meant that the box office saw a record number of attendees since Covid-19. Through analysing the fan generated content surrounding Barbenheimer, this research highlights how collective engagement can generate new cultural meanings and influence real world behaviours, such as the changes in cinema attendance and fan behaviour. I chose this case study because it appears that little has been explored on this topic, and what it communicates about the impact of fan communities.</p>\n<p>Structure<br />The structure of this study is divided into three sections: Humour and Mirroring, Visual codes and semiotics, Narratives in the media content.</p>\n<p>Section one is titled Humour and Mirroring to reflect the key ways that fan communities actively shaped and participated in the Barbenheimer phenomenon. Humour allows fans to creatively juxtapose the themes of Barbie and Oppenheimer through memes, trends and commentary. This engagement not only amplified the online discourse surrounding the films but made the aspect of a double feature more appealing to wider audiences. Mirroring captures the mimetic behaviour of fans, as seen through their participation in dressing up for screenings, engaging in Barbenheimer trends and replicating imagery from the movies. Mirroring also refers to the way that fans mirror each other, through their collective decision to participate in these trends.</p>\n<p>Section two is named &ldquo;Visual codes and semiotics&rdquo; to highlight the symbolic content that is embedded into the visual content produced by fan communities about Barbenheimer. This section focuses on the semiotic elements of Barbenheimer-related TikTok videos and how they make meaning. Specifically, how they construct and signify the juxtaposition between Barbie and Oppenheimer.</p>\n<p>Section three, titled &ldquo;Narratives in the media content&rdquo; examines how fan produced media can reshape the narratives around Barbie and Oppenheimer, through edits, comments and slideshows. This performs a crucial role in how Barbenheimer was understood and experienced.</p>\n<p>Data collection<br />I selected three TikTok videos that exemplify popular fan engagement of Barbenheimer. These videos were chosen based on:</p>\n<p>&bull; Their use of distinct visual and textual elements, such as cosplay, humour and colour codes.</p>\n<p>&bull; The user interactions within the comments section.</p>\n<p>&bull; Their viral status, regarding number of likes, shares and comments.</p>\n<p>I also extracted five comments from these three TikTok videos. These were chosen for their insight into how fans negotiate meaning and express emotion within the community.</p>\n<p>This information found on TikTok is eligible for this research due to the permission and privacy clauses that users agree to (TikTok, 2024). One practical issue of this study is the release date of the films being 2023. This made it time consuming to retrieve earlier content, given the fast-paced nature of TikTok, where new content is constantly emerging. A limitation of this study is that it focuses on a small sample size of TikTok videos and user comments. Despite this, it is an appropriate size within the context of qualitative research and the analytic methods that I have employed. This sample size is efficient as the focus of this study was on depth, aiming to produce a nuanced analysis of how fan communities engage with Barbenheimer. The videos chosen are highly representative and relevant to the Barbenheimer discourse, enabling an exploration of how meaning, identity and humour is constructed by fans.</p>\n<p>I also used secondary sources, such as scholarly data to carry out my research and add credibility to my analysis. It helped support and frame my research and allowed me to contextualise my findings.</p>\n<p>Data analysis<br />I started my analysis by introducing one TikTok, followed by the second TikTok. I then focused on the comments section of these videos. Lastly, I analyse a slide show and highlight the narrative elements that these media texts contain.</p>\n<p>This study employed both visual and discourse analysis, drawing on semiotic theories to explore the construct of meaning in TikTok videos relating to Barbenheimer. The visual analysis draws on Barthes&rsquo; narrative and symbolic codes, particularly how elements such as costume and colour convey cultural meaning. These codes allowed for an interpretation as to how fan generated content framed Barbenheimer as a cultural event.</p>\n<p>Discourse analysis is used in this study to examine how fans communicate affect, humour and belonging through the comments sections under the chosen TikTok videos. It is a method used to study language and understand how meaning is constructed. Discourse analysis can be used as a lense to analyse visual texts in the media (Rose, 2022). Before employing these tools, I considered what visuals signs are used to indicate affiliation with either Barbie or Oppenheimer and how are these interpreted by fans?</p>\n<p>The TikTok data in this study is analysed using Stuart Halls encoding/ decoding model (2007) to identify how fans interpret the encoded messages of the videos. The message often reflects the expectation to cosplay or participate in the humour. Some fans adopted a negotiated reading and would seek advice from fellow members of the fandom, which is central to Hall&rsquo;s model (2007). Discourse analysis is imperative in understanding what is being represented within these media texts, and how the visual codes and symbols frame this message. This helped me narrow my focus into how exaggeration was used to construct a shared language or attitude. I applied these frameworks to the comments section, specifically focusing on the emotive displays of fan participation.</p>\n<p>To contextualise these interactions, it was essential to draw on Jenkins concept of participatory culture and textual poaching (Jenkins, 2006, 2012). The comments illustrate fans active participation in constructing meaning and building a shared understanding of Barbenheimer. These actions reflect Jenkins view of fans as active participants and meaning makers, as opposed to passive spectators.</p>\n<p>McLuhan's (1994) concept of medium is the message frames TikTok itself as space where meanings are made. Using this concept, the affordances of TikTok shaped how fans engaged with Barbenheimer, thus revealing their contribution to the phenomenon. It explains how the meaning of Barbenheimer was shaped by TikTok itself.</p>\n<p>5. ANALYSIS/ DISCUSSION OF DATA</p>\n<p>It is important to first address how &ldquo;Barbenheimer&rdquo; is identifiable as a cultural phenomenon. The term &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; relates to the habits, traditions or beliefs of something. Phenomenon is described as something that exist and can be seen and is potentially unusual (Cambridge University Press, 2025). Through this, a cultural phenomenon can be recognised as a concept, behaviour or experience that is shaped by the practices of a society or group.</p>\n<p>Barbenheimer emerged as a result of social media users engaging in the simultaneous release of the films, Barbie and Oppenheimer. This encouraged an abundance of social interactions, influenced by the culture and trends that circulated both movies. This event caught the attention of mainstream media, inviting celebrities and influencers to partake in the discourse surrounding Barbie and Oppenheimer, further shaping a narrative.</p>\n<p>When discussing the impact of &ldquo;Barbenheimer&rdquo; as a cultural phenomenon, it is useful to recognise the origin of the name. Matt Neglia, owner of the Next Best Picture podcast, replied to a tweet announcing a first look of the cast of Barbie on Twitter (see appendix a). His response was simply &ldquo;Barbenheimer&rdquo; (Neglia, 2022). Introducing a pun (Brill, 1911) on the term &ldquo;Barbenheimer&rdquo; implies that Neglia&rsquo;s goal was to evoke a humorous notion. The joining of Barbie and Oppenheimer is intended to highlight the juxtaposition between the two movies. Barbie is a film associated with femininity, girlhood and the colour pink. Whereas Oppenheimer presents a historically grounded narrative, centred on the moral complexities behind the creation of the atomic bomb. The fact that these two contrasting films were announced to be released on the same day establishes a link between them, prompting comparisons through humour and encouraging audiences to engage with them.</p>\n<p>Shortly after Neglia&rsquo;s tweet, social media users begin to recognise the comedy that underlies this news, thus producing their own witticisms on the topic. This was carried out in the form of tweets, memes and videos. Many of which gained popularity on TikTok.</p>\n<p>The medium of TikTok allows for fan communities to engage with media about Barbenheimer in creative, collaborative ways (McLuhan, 1964). Viral trends emerge through memes, edits and cosplay videos that circulate the app. TikTok is a dynamic platform, where fan communities engage in discourse, via the comments section, and foster a shared, cultural consensus through the interactive features that the app offers.</p>\n<p>TikTok also functions in a way that facilitates transnational engagement. The concept of global village (McLuhan, 1962) means that people from diverse cultures and locations can engage with this phenomenon. The global interconnectedness of Barbenheimer also contributed to the impact on real life fan behaviours.</p>\n<p>For example, &ldquo;Barbenheimer resurrected cinemagoing&rdquo; (Mitchell, 2024, p.120). Noting that cinema attendance had not been the same since the Covid-19 pandemic. The enthusiasm from fans online had re-surfaced the concept of cinema going as event. The joint release of Barbie and Oppenheimer in the cinemas was followed with a trend of people arriving to the cinema wearing either pink, black, or cosplaying. The popularity of this trend allowed for differentiations to be made on who was there for Barbie or Oppenheimer. This contributed to the idea of Barbenheimer as a highly anticipated, cultural event and how it led to a resurgence in cinema attendance.</p>\n<p>Visual Codes and Semiotics <br />Figure 1<br /> <br />TikTok one: Barbenheimer outfit transition<br />Screenshot from @Katterynna (TikTok, 2023)</p>\n<p>Figure 1 is a video extracted from a TikTok titled &ldquo;Going to see Barbie after seeing the Oppenheimer&rdquo; (2023). The video begins with a close up of the Oppenheimer movie poster, it then pans to show the creator in full length, black leather jacket and sunglasses, her face expressionless. As the music transitions into an upbeat song, the creator takes off her jacket, revealing a pink dress. She places the sunglasses on her head and struts out of the frame whilst smiling.</p>\n<p>The signifier of this video refers to elements such clothing, music and captions (Saussure, 1959). The colour black, as a visual code (Barthes, 1967), is often associated with death, mourning, history, fear and mystery (Typeform, 2024). Oppenheimer explores many of these themes within the movie. The use of sunglasses and lack of expression signify an ominous message that ties with the theme of Oppenheimer as an emotionally intense movie.</p>\n<p>A signifier of the transition to the Barbie outfit is the song fading from a sombre tune to an upbeat, lyrical song from the Barbie soundtrack. This followed by the creator smiling, whilst revealing her pink dress underneath the jacket. The pink dress acts as a signifier; Pink has been associated with Barbie since the creation of the doll itself. During the production of the movie, set designers ran out of pink paint due to the directors&rsquo; request to &ldquo;maintain the kid-ness\" of the film (Treisman, 2023). Pink also signifies a certain type of traditional femininity along with tranquillity and peace (Cherry, 2024).</p>\n<p>The sign, in this context, is the portrayal of Barbenheimer as a trend. Both the signifier and signified features of the video enforce the concept of Barbenheimer as a cultural juxtaposition. Though the movies can be experienced in the same way, the meanings they evoke and the messages they convey are contrasting in various ways.</p>\n<p>The encoded message (Hall, 2007) within this video is that Barbenheimer is an event worth dressing up for. This is an opportunity for fans to socialise and express themselves through cosplay and post about it on social media. These messages are encoded through the visual elements such as costume, colour and captions. Encoding is also evident in the title of the video &ldquo;Going to see Barbie after seeing Oppenheimer&rdquo;. This conveys the idea that a double feature of these movies in one singular day is both socially acceptable and encouraged within the Barbenheimer fan culture.</p>\n<p>This amplification of this trend is depicted through the figure 2. The title of this video reads:<br />I love how you can tell who&rsquo;s watching Barbie and who&rsquo;s watching Oppenheimer just by looking at their outfits.<br />Figure 2<br /> <br />TikTok two: Differentiating audiences through outfits.<br /> Screenshot from @Samaellibrary (TikTok, 2023)</p>\n<p>The caption of this TikTok describes what is happening:<br />Everyone watching Barbie is wearing pink and everyone watching Oppenheimer is wearing black. The video pans the camera around the cinema, focusing on the crowds of people who are dressed up, the song playing in the background is from the official Barbie movie soundtrack.</p>\n<p>On a denotative level (Barthes, 1977), this video depicts that people&rsquo;s outfits visually signify which film they are attending, whether it be Barbie or Oppenheimer. The connotation here is that Pink is a signifier for Barbie, and black is a signifier for Oppenheimer. This surface level observation of the outfits linking both movies is part of a wider context. It is pushing the narrative that in order to be involved in the collective experience of Barbenheimer, dressing up or cosplay is expected.</p>\n<p>Observing TikTok as the message (McLuhan, 1994) offers insight into how this platform has shaped the reach of this event. The number of saves (27.5k) and likes (484k) on TikTok two reveal that the theme of outfits highly resonates with audiences. The likes and shares on this platform facilitate the reproduction and circulation of this media (Ageyo and Munchunku, 2020). Tools and technologies on TikTok allow for consumers to participate in this culture on their own terms (Jenkins, 2006). The DIY media production (Jenkins, 2006, p.135-136) is prevalent in the way that fans are dressing up in pink, or black to watch this movie. They are actively participating in this culture on their own terms. This use of content supports the affordance of humour on TikTok, allowing users to engage with this cultural phenomenon, through collectivity and humorous notions.</p>\n<p>Humour and Mirroring<br />Figure 3 shows a snapshot of a conversation between TikTok users. To understand the decoded message, I will also conduct a discourse analysis (Rose, 2022) of the comments section. <br />Figure 3<br /> <br />TikTok one: Conversation in comments section<br />Screenshot from @Katterynna (TikTok, 2023)</p>\n<p>A comment made by user one reads:<br />I literally watched Barbie and then Oppenheimer, so I did the same thing but backwards😂.</p>\n<p>User two responds:<br />Ok so I need to know because I&rsquo;m doing Barbenheimer on Sunday, if you did it again, what&rsquo;s the best order to see them? 😁.</p>\n<p>Paired together with the context of figure 1, these comments reveal that the concept of Barbenheimer has caused not only curiosity and debate around the order in which to view them, but also an emotional attachment (Lewis, 2002). The question asking what's the &ldquo;best&rdquo; order to see them implies that there is a right or wrong way. The discussion implies a collective effect that expands and binds together fans, their discourse and it&rsquo;s affect (Lewis, 2002).</p>\n<p>This process of collective and negotiated social interaction in the comments section produces a shared consensus. This form of interaction can be recognised as &ldquo;textual poaching&rdquo; (Jenkins, 2012), where fans are actively engaging with and remixing content about Barbenheimer, as a way of inserting themselves into the phenomenon. The use of varied online sources provides these fans with the tools to create their own interpretations of the trend. The understanding of humour as a social function (Martin, 2007) is useful in understanding why fans interact with one another. The humour of TikTok one acts as a means of fan interaction and participation, highlighting the role of humour in this phenomenon.</p>\n<p>Figure 3 also shows user three discussing their outfit as a response to the video:</p>\n<p>Watching Barbie right now with a black dress 👍 on Monday I&rsquo;m going to watch Oppenheimer with my dad.</p>\n<p>This pushes the narrative of a double viewing of Barbenheimer, that has been potentially influenced through the fluctuations of Barbenheimer videos on TikTok.</p>\n<p>Figure 4<br /> <br />TikTok one: Audience engagement<br />Screenshot from @Katterynna (TikTok, 2023)<br />Figure 4 displays a comment by a user four asking:</p>\n<p>Where is the dress frommm 😍</p>\n<p>This exchange implies both emotional engagement with the text, but also creative activity through the form of cosplay. It encapsulates the collective consumption of media through this TikTok.</p>\n<p>Fans of Barbie and Oppenheimer are formulating their own interpretations of the trend by sharing their outfit choices and seeking insight into the fashion choices made by this TikTok creator. This means that users are not only watching the video for its encoded message but are also interacting with the creators&rsquo; aesthetic. Elongation of the word &ldquo;from&rdquo; connotes a sense of enthusiasm and engagement with the text. Use of the heart eyes emoji connotes the admiration of the dress, and thus the creator who is presenting it. Fans are using the eco-system of TikTok to generate discourse on what to wear and how to dress for these events. This is a large element of TikTok culture as fashion and beauty automatically blend into content. These fans are utilising the affordances of TikTok to achieve their own goals and conform to the trend of Barbenheimer.</p>\n<p>The impact of fans using their voice within this group context, will enhance their decision-making and ultimately improve the group performance (Bashshur &amp; Oc, 2015). To expand, this sharing and cultivation of ideas will give fans the inspiration to dress up and to a higher standard, thus enhancing the level that this Barbenheimer trend is perceived on. This highlights the value of fan discourse, as it is elevating the performance of individuals who are conforming to the trend, thus benefiting the Barbenheimer movement.</p>\n<p>This idea of voice imparted onto the TikTok users, can be applied to the concept of the negotiated reading (Hall, 2007). The viewer partially accepted the encoded message but comes to terms in personal and collective ways on how to navigate it. Through asking questions to other members of this community, they are negotiating how they should approach the experience of Barbenheimer, based on other people&rsquo;s experience and preferences. These elements of fan interaction categorise Barbenheimer as an event that requires discussion and sharing of media artefacts amongst fans.</p>\n<p>Figure 5<br /> <br />TikTok two: Negotiating belonging through style<br />Screenshot from @Samaelibrary (TikTok, 2023)</p>\n<p>Returning to TikTok 2, Figure 5 presents a comment made by user five that poses the question: <br />GUYS WHAT DO I DO I DONT HAVE ANYTHING PINK AND I DONT REALLY WANT TO WEAR PINK BUT I STILL WANT TO FIT IN.</p>\n<p>This sentence being in capital letters is a visual signifier of heightened emotion or panic. The structure of this sentence, involving no punction or break suggests a sense of urgency. This urgency can be understood as a larger affective discourse within fandom, where emotional expression is exaggerated for engagement. In digital spaces like TikTok, the urgency becomes a shared language that amplifies both connection and authenticity, inviting others to do the same.</p>\n<p>The signified message is that there is a textual performance displaying the emotional attachment that fans have connected to the role of dressing up. It can be connotated that fans not only believe they should conform to this trend, but also that they want to. This is derived from the desire to fit in and be a part of the community.</p>\n<p>This process can be described through Textual poachers (Jenkins, 2012). Fans of this phenomenon go through TikToks&rsquo; that portray this trend, and engage with the parts they are interested in. This poaching from mass media content, by dressing up to the cinema, is a way of interjecting themselves into the culture of Barbenheimer (Jenkins, 2012).</p>\n<p>This act of fan participation corresponds with the concept of mimesis (Taussig, 1993). Mimesis, in this case, refers to fans copying materials and making models from one another, through the act of dressing up for Barbenheimer. It is the symbolic entry into the narrative world of Barbie and Oppenheimer, allowing fans to not only observe the movies, but temporarily immerse themselves into the culture that they greatly admire.</p>\n<p>In the book adoring audience, Lewis (2002) says that &ldquo;Not only do fans take part in and with the original industrial text, but they exceed and rework it.&rdquo; (p. 41). This is prevalent in the media texts generated around Barbenheimer. Fans chose to not simply wear pink, black, or exact cosplay to the cinema, but also a half Barbie and half Oppenheimer outfit (see figure 6 and 7).</p>\n<p>Figure 6 &amp; Figure 7<br /> <br />Duality of Barbenheimer through split aesthetic.<br />Screenshot one from @haarius (TikTok, 2023)<br />Screenshot two from @Showcasecinemasuk (TikTok, 2023)</p>\n<p>This encapsulates the message of Barbenheimer as a juxtaposition. Lewis (2002) notes that fans turn this performance into popular culture, through their participation. These forms of fan participation gained traction not only on social media, but also in mainstream media (see appendix b and c). <br /> <br />Narratives in the media content</p>\n<p>In his works on digital narratives and fandom, Paul Booth (2015) suggests that fandom is no longer about watching, but instead is about doing. Participatory culture means that fans can interact with and reshape media narratives (Jenkins, 2006).</p>\n<p>Figure 7 and 8 involves a slideshow post on TikTok, showing a series of images on the topic of Barbenheimer. These slideshows are frequently used on the app to creative narratives or display visual collages, with humour, emotion and culture fused into one post.</p>\n<p>Figure 8 &amp; Figure 9<br /> <br /> <br />TikTok three: Slideshow of Barbenheimer fan art<br />Screenshot from @__e.t.g__ (TikTok, 2023)</p>\n<p>Through decoding of these images, it becomes apparent that fans are actively constructing a narrative that Barbie and Oppenheimer are opposites. Drawing on Barthes&rsquo; concept of cultural codes (1977), the visual signifiers associated with both Barbie and Oppenheimer are used to reinforce the juxtaposition of the movies. This pairing of two culturally diverse movies becomes a playful, humorous narrative within fan discourse.</p>\n<p>One of the images depicts Oppenheimer on fire, mimesis (Taussig, 2018) here draws on the identity of Oppenheimer as a symbol of destruction and recontextualises it into this exaggerated interaction. The action of Barbie and Oppenheimer shaking hands symbolises the joining of two fandoms. It can be denoted through the likes (1.5 million) and shares (111.4k) of TikTok three that many fans have actively engaged in the idea of collaboration between fandoms. The connotation is that they are embracing this unity between fandoms by interacting with the video and sharing it with other members of the fandom. The humour initially evoked by this phenomenon has urged the production of new wit (Brill, 1911). This is evident in the slideshow format of the Barbenheimer content, detailing the many contributions made by fans.</p>\n<p>Debord (1994) defines spectacle as an instrument of unification that explains &ldquo;a great diversity of apparent phenomena&rdquo; (p. 107). The participation that occurs on TikTok symbolises the unification of the Barbie and Oppenheimer fandoms. It creates a sub fandom of &ldquo;Barbenheimer&rdquo;. This social relation amongst people is mediated through images such as the fan generated posters and edits of Barbenheimer.</p>\n<p>TikTok users operate as both consumers and producers of the spectacle (Toffler, 1980), thus blurring the lines between audience and creator. Chapman (2022) uses the term &lsquo;viewser&rsquo; (p.3) to specify the evolution of prosumers as seen on TikTok. The short form video style of TikTok, paired with its complex algorithm make content creation and distribution highly accessible. Through this, viewsers can frequently share forms of fan participation. This ability for fans to take on the role of producers is a powerful tool as &ldquo;fan participation can elevate a production in similar ways to how a producer could&rdquo; (Toffler, 1980). The evolution of social media apps such as TikTok, X, Instagram and so on mean that this content can be widely distributed, and this collective community can transpire across various platforms. <br /> <br />It important to recognise that the algorithm of TikTok prioritises content that aligns with high engagement (Zulli &amp; Zulli, 2022). Therefore, it would favour the cultural narratives that are being shared about Barbenheimer as it results in more engagement. In this context, two Hollywood studios have inadvertently benefited from this viral event. This raises the question as to whether the dual release represents an empowerment of fandom, or if it is an example of monetised chaos?</p>\n<p>Regardless, the phenomenon marked the first post pandemic year to achieve over 1 billion at the box office (Variety, 2024). The idea of a double viewing, facilitated by fandoms and their participatory culture, transformed into the cultural phenomenon that is known as &ldquo;Barbenheimer&rdquo;. This convergence of not only two opposing movies, but two fandoms illustrates the potency of fan driven trends in shaping a box office success. It reinforces the roles of fandoms as central in the creation and distribution of media texts (Jenkins, 2006).</p>\n<p>6. CONCLUSION <br />The purpose of this project was to investigate how fan communities engaged with and influenced the construction of Barbenheimer as a cultural phenomenon. The aim of this project specifies a focus on the humour, visual codes and narrative practices that help interpret this phenomenon. The key findings of this project highlight the role of fan participation in the shaping of Barbenheimer as a phenomenon. TikTok was used a tool in this participatory culture, enabling fans to remix Barbenheimer content through memes, cosplay and edits, turning the trend into a spectacle (Debord, 1994). Visual codes reveal that colours such as pink and black act as signifiers used to emphasise the contrast between the two films. This visual juxtaposition was amplified into a trend of people dressing up in either pink or black to watch the films. Fan interaction and discourse is evident in the comments section, revealing the desire to participate correctly in the trend. These meaning, as constructed through discourse between fans, mirror Jenkins &ldquo;textual poaching&rdquo; (2012) by re-working existing media into their own narratives.</p>\n<p>This study recognises the roles that TikTok users have taken on, as &ldquo;viewsers&rdquo; (Chapman, 2022), using the platforms tools to further distribute and influence the discourse surrounding Barbenheimer. The joining of two fandoms is evidenced through individuals sharing their half Barbie, half Oppenheimer cosplay outfits, which celebrates the unity of the two movies through these fan practices (Debord, 1994). As a result of these fan behaviours, mainstream media identified a revival of cinema going as an event, with audiences' members treating the cinema experience as a performance. Ultimately, this benefited cinema attendance numbers, post covid and defined Barbenheimer as a fandom driven, cultural phenomenon.</p>\n<p>This cultural event exemplifies how digital communities can construct a collective experience around two seemingly unrelated content; the only thing that these films had in common was their release date. From this, fans across various platforms embraced the juxtaposition between the films and shaped the broader narrative. These findings also highlight how social media can foster a global connection and cultural consensus; individuals who participate in Barbenheimer are inserting themselves into the community. This community operates in a space that fosters advice, questions and inspiration on how to navigate this phenomenon. It is a reflection of society's desire for unity and creativity in the digital age.</p>\n<p>If this research were to be expanded, a valuable area for exploration would be the integration of feminist theory to deepen the analysis of the cultural codes embedded within the Barbenheimer phenomenon. Both films present distinct gender themes, an investigation into how these films reflect, or subvert societal conversations around gender roles would provide a rich understanding into how the Barbenheimer phenomenon has shaped gender and other cultural practices in a contemporary society. Moreover, future research could explore how the dual release of Barbie and Oppenheimer represents a new template for participatory fan engagement, such as Wicked and Gladiator 2. A comparative case study between Barbenheimer and &lsquo;Glicked&rsquo; could clarify the longevity of this trend and how these fan practices transpire.</p>",

This challenges the beliefs of many media scholars who predicted that the accelerated use and reliance on technology will alter our everyday lives and real-world hobbies, assumably for the worse. As a result, this study will use theories on the use of media, media ecology, and digital communities for theoretical context, while creating a new perspective on the enrichment of social media.<br />The hashtag \"#BookTok\" (an identifying hashtag for the online community of book lovers specifically on TikTok) grounds this study within technology, analysing online communities. The advent of social media in leisure reading will aim to answer how #BookTok has gained traction and influenced the physical book reader in the real world. To further support theoretical predictions and assumptions about communities and leisure reading, a survey will reveal what the community represents for its members, why they use it and in what way they have adapted its use in the real world, alongside perceptions of people outside of the community. <br />This dissertation identifies that the hobby of leisure reading is in its begging stages of a total eclipse online, where the #BookTok community is helping promote and enrich leisure reading, not undermining it, but making it seem desirable. Thus this dissertation piece will be a critique of the old and an insight into a new definition of leisure reading.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Introduction<br />&ldquo;The advent of social media in leisure reading&rdquo; is a dissertation aiming to present a shift in leisure time activities, identifying its newly adapted forms within the internet, through the example of the #BookTok community on TikTok. This topic is inspired by the countless theorists agreeing on a shift in society&rsquo;s traditions and roles as consumers as a result of increasing technological innovations, while identifying a gap for further investigation into its consequences, attempting to shine a positive angle on the role of media for individuals. <br />Theories on &lsquo;media ecology&rsquo; and &lsquo;acceleration society&rsquo; helped introduce this understanding of society&rsquo;s reliance on and the infiltration of technology, but not always positively: fearing that technology will consume too much of an individuals&rsquo; personhood. Instead, this dissertation implies technological determinism has inspired a natural human defense to adapt: simply migrating real-life activities into the online, maintaining individualism, just in a different space. <br />Exploring themes of technology&rsquo;s effects on individuals is best investigated through hobbies (being a highly personal choice). Those who fear technology&rsquo;s ability to change, often refer to the decreased reliance on print literature, demonstrate growing rates of aliterate individuals and increasingly digitally literate people. However, this dissertation finds that reading physical books has adapted into an online &lsquo;book club&rsquo; (Jerasa &amp; Boffone, 2021, p. 221) called BookTok, no longer reflecting the solely real-world activity described by scholars. <br />The focus of the research being &lsquo;how has accelerated culture impacted leisure reading?&rsquo; this dissertation hopes to prove the hypothesis that leisure reading has surged in popularity because of the technological presence of online communities like BookTok. This community presents evidence of society&rsquo;s recent developments within the internet, a precursor to what is to come and evidence against assumptions that reading&rsquo;s popularity will dwindle. Hoping to strengthen the argument that reading physical books has not intentionally lost its value and is in fact promoting leisure reading to even more people, a self-administered survey will question participants on their observations about reading as a hobby and their knowledge, consumption and reliance on the BookTok community. <br />To unveil the significance of BookTok, the dissertation&rsquo;s aims are to show how it disproves scholar&rsquo;s predictions, what it means for readers, what it implies for technology&rsquo;s usage and how it correlates still with the real-world. This shall be structured through a literature review of both the theoretical perspectives backing this argument, alongside the case study&rsquo;s analysis, with a discussion and review of the research method (exploring patterns, anomalies and differing perspectives among the respondents of the survey), followed by a conclusion summarizing the relevance this dissertation holds in conjunction with media theories. This research is important for opening avenues of thought for future scholars about positive implications, moreover, a push to abandon old notions that have long been surpassed by technology. Familiarizing this dissertation&rsquo;s readers with what is relevant now (by analyzing the community popularizing leisure reading), is the true intention of this study. <br />Literature Review<br />1. Theoretical Framework<br />Fundamental theories of media and its integration in society shall be presented within this half of the literature review to contextualize the current position society holds within technology. Peer reviewed literature and journal articles ranging from the 1980s to present-day capture the range of opinions surrounding technological developments and predictions of the future, shaping this dissertation&rsquo;s positive understanding of the technological present. In turn, aiding the hypothesis attempting to counterargue fears associated with technology. Identifiable themes of technology sparking cultural changes, as well as the rejection and fears accompanying the speed up of society, shall structure this chapter and establish a base on which the discussion of #BookTok as a method of adaptation of technology may build upon. <br />1.1 Society&rsquo;s percieved acceleration to the rhythms of life<br /> Most scholars equate the feeling of societal acceleration to an increase of technological innovations (Leccardi, 2003; Rosa, 2010; Toffler, 1980). A faster pace of life Leccardi (2003, p. 34) predicts, is proof that we are entering or rather already embracing a &ldquo;truly new societal model&rdquo;. Rosa (2010, p. 78) specifies the processes in which we may observe this speeding up: in the technological, economic, social, and cultural spheres. It has been demonstrated that through the access of life-simplifying measures, humans grow too used to its acquisition and require more simplification of services, thus creating the feeling of a sped-up society where more technology is developed, compromising the pleasure of the time it takes to complete these actions. This is supported by Leccardi&rsquo;s statement that there has been a &ldquo;demise of the experience of time around which modernity is structured&rdquo; (2003, p. 38) which is a direct result of instantaneous technological inventions. Prior to this, Toffler (1980) conceptualizes a timeline of events leading up to the so called &lsquo;third wave&rsquo;. The two prior waves were identified by the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution (1980, p. 26). He recognizes that the emerging revolution (the &ldquo;Third Wave&rdquo;) would be highly technological and anti-industrial, thus giving way to the \"prosumer\" economics of tomorrow (1980, p. 27). These are the conditions observed in the modern day which this study embraces. <br />A metaphorical analogy is used by two authors, expressing waves of change, whom both add to the analogy that they may overlap and collide and meet resistance or even partial reversals (Rosa, 2003; Toffler, 1980). Toffler and Rosa prematurely warn what technology&rsquo;s development may bring after analyzing previous &ldquo;wave&rdquo; structures. Rosa (2010, p. 13) states that &ldquo;acceleration might outpace our capacities for the successful integration of temporal experience&rdquo;, which envelops the argument of hyper-acceleration as not only an observation of the present but a possible warning to question its end. Rosa offers little solutions to the matter, rather prioritizing the explanation and definition of accelerated society. While Toffler on the other hand offers predictions and solutions (like political incentives and cultural changes). <br />Future scholars may wish to propose a resolution to fill the research gap of modern interpretations, while this dissertation is presenting another approach. Instead of categorizing social acceleration as innately damaging and with seemingly no end, this study presents a view of people&rsquo;s adaptation to the high speeds of today, initiating a discussion of an extended Third Wave, or even Fourth Wave, using what has already been observed by scholars. Individuals have found ways to use these inventions to help restyle their life to regain an element of slow culture, an example of which being the #BookTok community promoting or introducing the hobby of leisure reading as a method to regain consciousness in the shrunken temporal dimension. In the words of Toffler (1980): <br /> &ldquo;Millions are already attuning their lives to the rhythms of tomorrow. Others, terrified of the future, are engaged in a desperate, futile flight into the past and are trying to restore the dying world that gave them birth.&rdquo; (p.25)<br />1.2 Cultural impacts and changes of technology <br />This shift is acknowledged and later developed by media scholars, centralizing the notion that technological innovations &ldquo;extend human beings, human capabilities, and the human body&rdquo; (Strate, 2004, p. 7) which are concept relating to Media Ecology and Technological Determinism (TD), considering the relationship between technology and humans, much like this dissertation with hobbies. <br />Jan et al. (2020) find in this digital age, scholarly focus is on social media. Their analysis of key scholars concludes that TD assumes that &ldquo;ideologies, human communication behavior, teaching-learning settings, pastime and means of amusement&rdquo; have changed through our use of new technology (2020, p. 136). Confirming this digest, key contributor Postman (2000) introduced phrases like &lsquo;Media Ecology&rsquo;, metaphorically constructing Media as a petri dish which cultivates cultures, &ldquo;giving form to... politics, social organization, and habitual ways of thinking.&rdquo; (2000, p. 10). Hauer (2017, p. 3) furthers this view by identifying the so called &lsquo;new literacy&rsquo; of digital literacy as being an &ldquo;integral part of twenty first century man&rdquo;. This shall be used as proof of the thorough integration of technology by individuals and groups, already observed by scholars, to then offer an example of this unification through the #BookTok case study. This dissertation patches these premature predictions with a modern-day example, contributing to the TD field with an evaluation of how people have overcome this rapid change. <br />The Uses and Gratifications theory of Blumler and Katz will further shape analysis of the integration and cultural impact or technology because of its identification of why individuals choose to consume media. Katz et al. summarize scholar&rsquo;s attempts at defining media gratification in 1973, identifying that although each study created its own classification, compared to each other, they share similar categories of gratifications (1973, p. 512). Blumler and Katz proceeded to define their own research, identifying six true clusters of reasons children had for watching television: a Habit, for Arousal, for Companionship, to Relax, to Forget and to Pass Time (1974, p. 77). They critique their own findings, identifying it is a narrowed view of just the television medium, but scholars ought to examine these clusters among other media (1974, p. 89). As is attempted in this discussion of TikTok, these categories were asked of respondents in the survey (see Appendix 1), narrowed down to four classifications inspired by their findings: Diversion, Personal Relationship, Personal Identity and Surveillance. Attempting to analyze Uses and Gratifications within social media, may further explain which classification chosen feels a closer tie to online communities, and/or how different their experiences may be from what participants express their technological uses to be. <br />1.3 Rejection and Fears <br />Those also acknowledging the pace of life include Osbaldiston (2013) in &lsquo;Culture of the Slow&rsquo; as they explain that our lifestyles have become increasingly &ldquo;hectic, fast, complex and immediate&rdquo; (2013, p. 1). The premise of their book suggests a need to &lsquo;step back&rsquo; and &lsquo;slow down&rsquo;. This in turn will achieve a &ldquo;recapturing of the essence of &lsquo;real&rsquo; living&rdquo; (2013, p.1) and emphasizes scholarly thoughts that slowness reflects atypical norms of the current age, rather something &ldquo;synonymous with meaningfulness&rdquo; (2013, p. 5). As is reading, perhaps. <br />Wyatt untangles the notion that technological progress equals social progress (2008, p. 168), explaining that this view is &ldquo;misleading and dangerous&rdquo; (2008, p. 172). This derives from her analysis of technology and inventions as lacking space for human choice or intervention and more importantly the responsibility we assume over that what we make (2008, p. 169). Similarly, Castells characterizes the discourse around the developing technological revolution as &lsquo;prophetic&rsquo; and &lsquo;ideological manipulation&rsquo; (1996, p. 29). He interprets the hype and &ldquo;diffusion of technology&rdquo; as a reminder and amplifier of &ldquo;the power of technology&rdquo; (1996, p. 31); which he duly notes that its creation came about from the &ldquo;unique blending of military strategy, big science cooperation, technological entrepreneurship, and countercultural innovation&rdquo; (1996, p. 45) which is not heavily emphasized enough in his extract that it may be a cause of concern of its intended use. At the time of his writing, people treated Information technology as on par with the new sources of energy &ldquo;successive to the industrial revolutions&rdquo; (1996, p. 30). Adding to the emphasis of integration by noting that it is a &ldquo;constant background presence, the fabric of our lives.&rdquo; finalizing that &ldquo;We live with the media and by the media.&rdquo; (1996, p. 362). <br />What these authors have in common is the unquestioned notion that media surrounds us and has enveloped our everyday lives, acknowledged in this literature on a scale of how harshly it impacts society and therefore individuals. Despite the time of writing, Castells foresees that technology will be &ldquo;appropriated and redefined by its users&rdquo; (1996, p. 31), central to the framework of this dissertation and possibly the quote that further inspires this paper. This segways perfectly into the following section of the literature review that regards the case study of #BookTok and leisure reading. A rejection of the fast in admiration or even need for the slow accompanies the essence of reading books, being time-consuming! <br />2. Case Study <br />Now that key media theories to this study have been established, they must now be positioned with literature surrounding the case study. Two sections shall separate these secondary sources: the history and future of books and leisure reading, then an exploration of the TikTok community &lsquo;#BookTok&rsquo;. Sources span from 1984 up until present day, seemingly representative of the advent and current nature of technology and the internet. Although not particularly framed by the previously mentioned media theories, this dissertation finds the case study readings to identify acceleration society and moral panics surrounding the losing value of literature. Few of the early writers saw the possibility of adaptation to the high speeds of the internet, while more modern authors identified a shift. That research gap is being filled by this study with examples of this new mold. <br />2.1 Bookish history and predictions <br />First, using Daily (2018), we may define what a hobby is as it underpins the analysis of the technological change on an individual rather than a societal scale. Including reading, hobbies are &ldquo;beneficial leisure or non-work occupations&rdquo; (2018,p. 368) which people participate in because they are &ldquo;intrinsically rewarding&rdquo; (2018, p. 371). Boorstin (1984) does well to explain the importance books hold and have held in our societies; reminding the reader that religions use books as sacred texts (also in reference to the Gutenberg Bible- a significant first step for print literature), education relies on them as does politics as a source of knowledge, faith, morality, philosophy and history (1984, p. 11). However, in modern times book prices have risen, and libraries are closing. <br />In the same breadth authors acknowledge and warn about changing reliance on these books as a result of technological innovations (Birkerts, 1996; Knulst and Kraaykamp, 1998; Knulst and van den Broek, 2003). Birkerts identifies that the process of transmitting information is shifting from mechanical to circuit- driven, from page to screen (1996, p. 212). Instead of philosophizing we are more interested in managing the overload of information (Birkerts, 1996, p. 213). Knulst and Kraaykamp (1998) find that the sheer amount and accessibility of reading materials has harmed its appreciation. It now competes with the television (1998, p. 21) as well as the lack of time in daily life and increasing number of leisure alternatives (1998, p. 32). Knulst and van den Broek (2003) quantified that 49% of the population read books once a week in 1975, dropping to just 31% in 2000 (2003, p. 219). These factors position technology as the book&rsquo;s enemy, also implied but not specified by scholars of the previous chapter. These predictions shall be compared with findings of this study, to disprove the age-old argument that too much technology is negatively impacting individuals. <br />Despite the opposition, scholars have proposed alternative takes on this &ldquo;imminent disappearance of the book&rdquo; (Maziarczyk, 2022, p.109), the narrative this dissertation follows: a belief of a positive future alongside technology. Books and screens are not natural enemies explains Maziarczyk (2022, p. 111), rather complementary. New literacy must be understood away from its association with reading print novels (2022, p. 111) as it is entering another stage entirely. #BookTok is an example of a new mode and new literary expression, differing from in-person book clubs and other social media sites bookish community attempts. <br />Chamberlain (2012) acknowledges a shift in readers requirements, accrediting it to the new publishing eco-system, where book sellers and authors have taken advantage of the online (2012, p. 58), and undoubtedly the audiences it attracts. Even earlier analysis of Boorstin in 1984 identifies a habit of writing &ldquo;premature obituaries&rdquo; (1984, p. 11), criticizing those who predicted a fall or disappearance in leisure reading. His argument pertains to the traditional book lacking the novelty and commercial hype that technology has (1984, p. 23). This is the natural progression and migration referenced within the introduction observed by this study. Books and publishers must adapt to the new technological world or &lsquo;Third Wave&rsquo;, to withstand faster moving requirements of consumers. Therefore, weaknesses of the opposing team prove a lack of perspective and dangerous assumptions that all traditional modes and functions shall remain. The computer actually facilitates book reading and writing (1984, p. 28), therefore requiring computer literacy, which Boorstin uncovers as the new avenue to knowledge that print media once maintained; furthering the argument that technology has shifted our social systems thus requiring the letting-go of old ones. This perspective, presented through #BookTok and its association with an important and existing societal function (imagination/ entertainment and the maintenance/ protection of knowledge), finally proposes an evaluation of the technological effects scholars diligently warned us of. <br />2.2 #BookTok case study <br />Social media has become an &ldquo;integral aspect of individuals' everyday routines&rdquo; Ridzuan and Ahmadrashidi (2023, p. 75) rightly observe. Tik Tok being one of the leading apps, finding success with Gen Z because of its &ldquo;messy, chaotic, campy, and genuine&rdquo; aesthetic (Jerasa &amp; Boffone, 2021, p. 220) which had only entered the U.S. market in August 2018 and has only grown in users, viewers and creators since. Currently standing at over one billion downloads in the Play Store. Furthermore, scholars (Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi, 2023; Jerasa &amp; Boffone, 2021) identify subcultures/ virtual communities appertaining to interests and hobbies emerging within mediums like TikTok, nurturing a tailor-made experience. A popular example being BookTok, the TikTok subculture (and hashtag) Jerasa &amp; Boffone (2021, p. 219) refer to as enthusiastic about &ldquo;reading and discussing (mostly) young adult literature&rdquo;, a &ldquo;space created by youth for youth&rdquo; (2021, p. 220), but also a space connecting authors, publishers, and readers (Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi, 2023, p. 75). <br />Before there was BookTok, there were book blogs in the 1990s to early 2000s, that developed into the book vlog (video log) like BookTube on YouTube, then Bookstagram on Instagram, and now #BookTok on TikTok (Low et al., 2023, p. 5), emerging as early as March 2020. Dezuanni et al&rsquo;s. (2022) list of content this hashtag showcases, ranges from &ldquo;book reviews, &lsquo;shelfies&rsquo;, book cover reveals, recommendations, unboxing videos, critiques of controversial content, trends, as well as TBRs (to-be-read piles of books).&rdquo; (2022, p. 356). Those micro-celebrities who produce the videos pay significant attention towards curating an &ldquo;emotional or intimate connection with their followers.&rdquo; (2022, p. 370). This indicates a community not solely driven by the profits it creates (Reddan et al., 2024, p. 18), but the exposure to literary culture and leisure reading it generates. <br />This group of young readers online has &ldquo;revitalized the popularity of reading for a new generation&rdquo; claims James (2022, p. 2), sharing sentiments with Dezuanni et al. (2022, p. 371) as well as Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi (2023, p. 80) as it is &ldquo;nurturing a vibrant literary culture&rdquo;. This is the evidence presented throughout this study as a telltale sign of our already developed migration, not as a forced alienation due to the speed of production and consumption, but a willingness to connect with even more people to share hobbies. Statistics presented by Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi (2023, p.76) signify a &ldquo;significant alteration in reading patterns&rdquo; showing that between 2020 and 2021, BookTok inspired a &ldquo;70% increase in reading engagement&rdquo; which is not surprising when the hashtag has &ldquo;over 47.7 B views&rdquo; (2022, p.356) according to Dezuanni et al. in 2022. <br />To summarize, using Reddan et al., consumption of social media is growing in importance for readers (2024, p. 15), although it is important to note that not all use social media (representative of the survey findings). The &lsquo;BookTok phenomenon&rsquo; (Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi, 2023, p. 75) is widening horizons for publishers and authors to promote their products and collaborate with those right at the source of &ldquo;cultural authority&rdquo; (2024, p. 17) and therefore influencing participants of the BookTok community. Reddan et al. (2024) predicts, like this dissertation, that: <br />&ldquo;Social reading practices will continue to evolve alongside digital technologies. While the proliferation of bookish social media content indicates that readers will continue to engage with books and reading in digital spaces.&rdquo; (p. 79)<br />Utilizing the overview these scholars have made of the BookTok community has proven and presented the opinion of its do-gooding and establishment for the future. Without maybe realizing it, these scholars have aided in the works explaining TD and Media Ecology frames of the modern day, presenting TikTok as an app encompassing cultures and communities typically witnessed in social groups and after school clubs. A presentation of what the current stage of media is, in terms of embracing the fast life and changing it to fit around habits and slow culture hobbies is what this dissertation is defining. <br />Research Method<br />1. Research Question, Aims and Objectives <br /> Bornman (2009, p. 428) discusses the steps a researcher must take when conducting survey research, the first of which is to establish a research question and hypothesis. This study aims to answer the research question, &ldquo;How has accelerated culture impacted leisure reading ?&rdquo;. Now, in order to deliver a hypothesis, it is necessary to outline said objectives that inspired the question that frames this dissertation and the research method. <br /> These objectives are to find 1. the significance that the #BookTok community holds for those who read as a hobby; 2. disprove scholarly predictions that reading physical books will decline with the advent of digitization and technology; 3. explore the ways accelerated culture affects our leisure time activities; 4. present a correlation between #BookTok interaction and engagement with physical book consumption. <br />It is evident that these objectives stem and develop from one another, with the intent to prove the advent of social media&rsquo;s presence in offline, real-life hobbies. The hypothesis, therefore, is that leisure reading has surged in popularity because of the technological presence of online communities like #BookTok. <br />2. Research Design, Outline and Ethics<br /> In an attempt to answer the research question, this subheading will discuss the research method used to prove the above-mentioned hypothesis and to provide adequate evidence for the dissertation. This study examines the technological undertakings of hobbies and the way in which offline activities are being projected into online spaces. To study social practices requires qualitative research from the social sphere itself. Webb et al. (2015, p. 91) refer to this type of method as one that can provide rich descriptions of people&rsquo;s feelings and experiences. As a result, the qualitative approach will be the most adequate in giving insight into the community and their thoughts. Additionally, Berger (2000, p. 173) notes, &ldquo;content analysis itself provides no direct data about the nature of the communicator, audience, or effect&rdquo;. To gather information relating to the significance of the #BookTok community, surveys will be the best method to ask both qualitative questions and gather empirical data.<br />To answer the aims, the target population was strategically aimed at internet users (by distributing it mostly online, requiring internet access) as insider knowledge of the community will be valuable alongside outsider knowledge. If this survey was targeted at just those members of the community, answers would be biased and unrepresentative of leisure readers. Not all readers use social media or dictate their next reads based on #BookTok reviews but may reveal that online content influences offline life (like bookstores creating sections dedicated to TikTok recommendations). Likewise, non-readers are not inclined to be part of #BookTok but will have heard of it or perhaps stumbled upon it&rsquo;s more aesthetically pleasing videos rather than book content. Samples therefore were gathered mostly through social media platforms and student forums with a QR code (also to generate the largest number of responses)- still generating a mixed pool of readers and non-readers. But a partial bias towards a student population must be acknowledged at hindering broader responses, despite their differing opinions. <br />Kayam &amp; Hirsch (2012, p. 57) propose that social media networks &ldquo;can and should be viewed as the potential way of reaching participants in social studies research&rdquo;. Due to the nature of this study and the advice of Kayam &amp; Hirsch (2012), a self-administered survey will be used. This survey is defined as a questionnaire given directly to participants to complete themselves (Bornman, 2009, p. 449) and described as a &ldquo;very personal research method&rdquo; (Bornman, 2009, p. 427). Advantages include minimal costs and time saving (Kayam &amp; Hirsch, 2012) alongside those outlined in Figure 1. Concerns for this survey include participation rates needed to gain a representative set of data and misunderstanding of questions. These should largely be avoided through distribution efforts, being both online and offline, and using simple language, avoiding jargon and opening a line of communication for asking questions. <br />Ethical concerns are at a minimum; Along with the granted and approved Ethics Certificate, this research complies with the ten standards of American Psychological Association (APA) code of ethics which include competence, privacy and confidentiality as well as record keeping (Cherry, 2024). No personal data is shared in the data collection process aside from the answers given, all evidence was kept in a secure folder and destroyed a year after its collection, there are no triggering topics, consent is available to be withdrawn, and the research does not target vulnerable groups. However, required access to the internet to answer the survey may exclude certain participants.<br />The survey was conducted using Google Forms for simplicity and accessibility. This proved particularly beneficial as it held zero costs for its use, is available to anyone with internet access and has no limitations on the respondent amount. Kayam and Hirsch (2012) add that the security level can be adjusted (like the removal of sharing personal information such as emails), and participant answers were recorded &ldquo;automatically into a spreadsheet associated with Google Documents.&rdquo; (2012, p. 62). <br />The survey used for this dissertation (seen in Appendix 1) is &ldquo;reproducible and generalizable&rdquo; (Lai &amp; To, 2015, p. 141) because of its questions and Google Forms format. This is to allow for the collection, analysis, and longitudinal monitoring of information regarding #BookTok and leisure reading trends, explain Lai &amp; To (2015, p. 141); which in turn can be used to analyze shifts, which is the intention set by this study: to allow future scholars to use this study for evidence and to extend their own beliefs towards the rise of leisure reading or technology&rsquo;s benefits among individuals. Therefore, this method is best suited for this dissertation for its exploration of respondent&rsquo;s opinions and present day observations.<br />Figure 1<br />Advantages and Disadvantages of self-administered surveys <br />Note. Adapted from Bornman (2009, pp. 449 &ndash; 450).&emsp;<br />Research Analysis<br />1. Quantitative Survey Analysis</p>\n<p>Figure 2<br />Quantitative Table Key</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&emsp;<br />As evidence that supports the hypothesis and aims of the dissertation as a whole, this analysis chapter will discuss the answers provided from the self-administered survey (see Appendix 1). A separation of the Quantitative and the Qualitative data shall paint a picture of the variables one may assume when participating in the BookTok community, why they engage and who does not, as well as some interesting anomalies. Respondents will be referred to by number in the chronological order in which the survey was answered; identified by &lsquo;R&rsquo; to mean respondent like &lsquo;R1&rsquo; for Respondent 1. <br />The quantitative data analyzed within the study were separated by the types of questions asked that produced easy numerical results, like the difference between yes and no answers. Of the seventeen questions asked (excluding the question for consent at the beginning of the survey), nine questions were deemed appropriate for statistical evaluation. This data helped position who these respondents were and their standing with, or distance from the online community BookTok. Evidence was compiled in Table 1, shown above. The column headings (horizontal) indicate survey questions (summarized into a singular word or phrase). While the row header (vertical) classified the 25 respondents. Although not a statistically representative cross-section of society, results showed diverse, individualistic opinions and expected ratios of difference. Three types of respondents emerged at first glance, summarized in Figure 2 (the key) and highlighted across the table for visual correlation. <br />The results from Question 1 in Table 1 demonstrate that 72% of respondents classified themselves as readers, versus 28% that were not. Majority of respondents judged themselves as a number 4 on the scale of &lsquo;not reading very often&rsquo; (being 1) and &lsquo;reading very often&rsquo; (being 5) in Question 2. Although the question was up to interpretation by the respondents and this could not evaluate who and what they judge as &ldquo;often&rdquo; or not, &ldquo;not reading very often&rdquo; (chosen by 24% of respondents) was the second most popular choice. This is a reoccurring binary within these findings: being a somewhat regular and involved reader versus hardly at all. <br />Contrary to the volume of leisure reading participants, when asked one of the dissertations aims, if they believed there has been a decline in reading since the development of the internet (Question 12), a majority (16/25) observed a decline. As referenced in the literature review, several scholars (Birkerts, 1996; Knulst and Kraaykamp, 1998; Knulst and van den Broek, 2003) expressed a decline in a need for books or it being in competition with other entertainment technologies or simply too overwhelmed with choice. Therefore, this survey is consistent with previous scholarly literature, although outdated. More recent studies discuss the need to evaluate the decline in reading in alternative ways (Chamberlain, 2012; Maziarczyk, 2022). The answer &lsquo;Maybe&rsquo; was selected seven times; this is undefined and again interpreted by the participants but is evidence towards a contemplation between the decline or a recent increase. Yet again aiding this dissertation with evidence of a changing narrative towards literature online, despite only two participants voting for &lsquo;no&rsquo; decline. <br />Considering BookTok is on TikTok, it was imperative to analyze who could have access to the community. As such, Question 3 research finds that 84% (21/25) R currently have and use TikTok. Of the 21 R, 17 knew of BookTok and 5 did not; 4 of which were not readers to begin with (LB team) which was unsurprising. However an exception occurred in the LB team with R20, who knew of BookTok, having &ldquo;seen their videos&rdquo;. In contrast, R18, a reader, with TikTok, was the only one who hadn&rsquo;t heard of BookTok (of the16 readers who had TikTok and knew of BookTok). Furthermore, a reader (R13), without TikTok (B group) had still heard of BookTok through &ldquo;word of mouth&rdquo;. Although the majority matched expectations in their predisposition towards the community, the two anomalies who still knew of BookTok are unsurprising as the internet is spread far and wide and touches even those who do not participate with it, also proof of the community&rsquo;s popularity outside of the internet. <br />A test was conducted on the frequency of BookTok videos appearing on respondents For-You-Pages (FYP) in Question 16, revealing the relevance that these videos have on individual's social media. Of the Magenta group, 6/8 experienced anywhere between 0-5 videos on their FYP within five minutes, while only two had 6 videos or more. 10 people, not in the Magenta or Blue group (13 altogether) shared 0-1 videos of BookTok, as expected. And yet, there is an inconsistency in who feels part of the community. Only 8/25 are part of BookTok as opposed to the other 9 respondents who knew of BookTok. R9 answered independently, explaining that they &ldquo;interact with the community's content, but does not search for it&rdquo;. This may be testament to the already expressed notion that these questions are largely for interpretation, others may share R9&rsquo;s sentiments but would rather define themselves as not part of the community, despite coming across their videos (actively, although not consciously participating in them). <br />Asking how influenced (1 being never influenced and 5 being very influenced) they were to purchase books recommended by BookTok, Question 14 revealed stereotypical answers (condensed into Figure 3). Unsurprisingly M group and a new group (of readers using TikTok but not part of BookTok) kept to the highest-to-middle ends of the scale, like the binary B and LB groups who were at the lowest and least influenced end. <br />The Uses and Gratifications theory&rsquo;s categories for consumption was directly asked as a multiple-choice question for participants to reveal why they are compelled to use social media (specifically TikTok), linking to the backbone of this dissertation. A pattern emerged in Question 4: the most popular answer for TikTok users (8/21) selected only Diversion, with 5/21 selecting both Diversion and Surveillance. These R are most interested in escapism and/or obtaining information. The least picked category was for Personal Identity (3/21), a statistic that was not expected in a study on the popularity and effects of an online community. This may be rectified by the 5/21 people who considered Personal Relationships as a motivation, maintained and nurtured within BookTok perhaps for reading groups of people. <br />Figure 3<br />Summary of answers from Question 14 in the survey</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&emsp;<br />2. Qualitative Survey Analysis <br />Unsurprisingly, identical binary groups were found among the qualitative answers within the survey. The Light Blue and Magenta team (Figure 2) remain relevant in this analysis, however, one more group emerged among the readers (briefly identified in Figure 3) who did not feel part of BookTok (identified as the Orange group). Their perspective is useful when determining what individuals constitute as being part of the case study and position the current popularity of the studied community, helping future scholars predict its development. These responses shall be examined alongside the previously mentioned literature and theories to further prove the research question. <br />2.1 What do you know about BookTok? <br />Question 6 asked what the non-readers assumed the community was. Interestingly more than one respondent (R2, R8, R10, R16) identified the community as a &ldquo;place&rdquo; or &ldquo;side&rdquo; of TikTok. Examples include: &ldquo;a social place where you can read books&rdquo; (R16) and a &ldquo;side of TikTok where people enjoy reading and discussing books&rdquo; (R10). LB respondents correspond BookTok with the discussion of books. This closely relates to Postman (2000) and his introduction to the Media Ecology framework. He expands the &ldquo;global village&rdquo; metaphor, expressing technology as emulating the feeling of a village (close-knit for example) on a grander, global scale: In the same way #BookTok demonstrates a village within the online world. Further emulating Postman&rsquo;s notion that media &ldquo;gives form to a culture&rsquo;s politics, social organization, and habitual ways of thinking.&rdquo; (Postman, 2000, p.10), the online community experiences social hierarchies (such as greater or lesser followers), and controversies (like disagreeing opinions and divided preferences) as well as a shared language or abbreviations (like &lsquo;TBR&rsquo; for To Be Read). <br />Both Magenta and Orange define BookTok in Question 8 as a &ldquo;community&rdquo; known for its &lsquo;book recommendations and reviews&rsquo; (R1,3,4,5,7,9,13,17,23,25). Whom most interact with its content through likes, comments, saving, and sharing/ reposting, answered in Question 10; these are typical of the features utilized within TikTok to distribute content to friends and followers, and inform the algorithm of one's interests (Reddan et al., 2024, p. 5). R19 (although in the Orange group) expressed this deliberate action to recall content by liking videos &ldquo;in hopes to be recommended with further books&rdquo;, possibly acknowledging that other R do so subconsciously. It further illustrates that the Orange group enjoy the BookTok content but lack the feeling of integration within the community. The requirements needed to feel integrated have not yet been studied and are not answered by this dissertation and could be a suggestion for future scholars to develop.<br />2.2 Usefulness and Importance of BookTok <br />Regardless of its newness, BookTok serves as a &ldquo;convenient and effective platform for both readers and marketers alike&rdquo; (Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi, 2023, p. 79) and its outlook is &ldquo;undeniably positive&rdquo; (Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi, 2023, p. 81). Question 11 asked R on their views of the importance BookTok has in promoting leisure reading. The LB group members, although not part of, nor having heard of the community before, acknowledge it as a &ldquo;modern spotlight on the world of books&rdquo; (says R11) and providing &ldquo;role models&rdquo; (R10). M and O group share an attitude of BookTok&rsquo;s role in spreading interest in reading, as they are &ldquo;trend setters&rdquo; (R1) and portraying it as a &ldquo;welcoming hobby&rdquo; (R6) as well as aiding in the &ldquo;pivotal resurgence of reading&rdquo; (R7), &ldquo;sparking interest and discussion&rdquo; (R15). Its existence and potential outreach to non-readers can be credited to the role of the internet. The same way Jan et al. (2020, p, 134) summarize that mass media &ldquo;shapes attitudes and behavior of people and brings a revolution in the mode of operation of a social system.&rdquo;, this dissertation concludes that BookTok has adapted to the surge in technology, altering the space for a community of readers. Not all R shared this view, like O group R17, claiming the community &ldquo;targets already reading audiences&rdquo;. They perhaps do not observe chances for new readers to connect due to their heavily established colloquialisms and popular video topics (recommendations, hauls, bookshelf organization or fan theories). However, as the majority have shown, new readers fall into the community through simply coming across the videos and becoming more influenced to purchase books as a result. <br />Scholars (Low et al., 2023; Ridzuan and Ahmadrashidi, 2023) observe that it serves as a marketing space for publishers and authors. Respondents in the O team expressed a positive view on this use in Question 11: as &ldquo;important to small authors&rdquo; (R7) and &ldquo;marketing and targeting audiences&rdquo; (R13). On the other hand, two R in M group express its &ldquo;bias towards particular books&rdquo; (R25) and &ldquo;purposeful selection of books in book stores&rdquo; (R12), indicating a marketing ploy. This brings into question ideas within Uses and Gratifications: (U&amp;G) that despite a popular motivation for R being &lsquo;Diversion&rsquo; to use TikTok, the selling of a product or service is all the more prevalent (also answered in Question 14, evaluated in Figure 3 of their likelihood of being influenced to purchase items recommended). It should be noted that the original U&amp;G theory revolved around television and hadn't yet met the vast possibilities of the internet, suggesting the &lsquo;uses&rsquo; for media do not align with the content currently being produced. The global village is a perfect opportunity to sell products, especially with the growing \"prosumer economics of tomorrow&rdquo; that Toffler (1980) describes. Evidence of BookTok&rsquo;s involvement in prosumer-ism is already identified among studies (Dezuanni et al., 2022; Reddan et al., 2024) enquiring the BookTok phenomenon&rsquo;s ability to make a particular book popular, sought out and even sold out. Monetary gain remains persistent as does &ldquo;attention economy&rdquo; among social media content, explains Reddan et al. (2024, p. 17), but disputes the assumption with evidence from interviews conducted with bookish creators who failed to identify &ldquo;income or monetary gain as a motivation for creating content&rdquo; (2024, p. 18). Instead &ldquo;authenticity and community are important norms shaping the content and commercial environment&rdquo; (2024, p. 17). Books naturally pick up popularity when placed in a community of like-minded people who understand the needs and satisfaction required of other readers, not necessarily to sell books, but to provide informed decisions before purchasing. <br />2.3 Decline or Resurgence in reading? <br />When asked if there has been a decline in reading physical books (Questions 12 and 13), the 92% of respondents who answered &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;maybe&rsquo;, point out that reading is now accessible online through audiobooks and e-books (seen in R6,7,12,13,15,19,24,25 answers). Unified notions of &ldquo;shortening attention spans&rdquo; (R4) and &lsquo;hyper-focus on phones or the internet&rsquo; (R9,18,22) were described as additional causes, implying online reading as a replacement of traditional physical book reading. Hauer (2017, p. 3) extends &lsquo;new literacy&rsquo; (digital literacy) as being a large source of societal change, due to technological developments. This serves as proof of a shift for communities and their hobbies of interest, replacing physical social groups with &ldquo;hypertextual forms of communication and literary expression.&rdquo; (Maziarczyk, 2022, p. 109).<br />As the consumption of social media content of readers is becoming &ldquo;an increasingly important part of their digital lives&rdquo; (Reddan et al., 2024, p. 15) so too is the importance to re-analyze existing societal norms (Maziarczyk, 2022, p. 111). Question 15 asks R their observations relating to a resurgence or growth in leisure reading. LB group mostly observed &lsquo;no growth&rsquo; (predicably with their lack of association and integration with the hobby) offering little explanation why. O group and M group join in recognition of certain books growing in popularity, becoming more &ldquo;in demand&rdquo; (R9), &ldquo;selling out&rdquo; (R1,3,25) and acknowledge the &lsquo;phenomenon of books rising to fame&rsquo; (R15,24) with the help of BookTok. Also mentioning the &ldquo;acceptance&rdquo; (R4,) and trendiness/ popularity (R7,17) that reading now holds. These observations answer the Research Question: &ldquo;How has accelerated culture impacted leisure reading; exploring #BookTok&rsquo;s influence on physical book consumption?&rdquo;. Despite this new norm of reading being audiobooks or e-books, bookstores remain in business and even &ldquo;create #booktok displays in store&rdquo; (Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi, 2023, p. 80) proving a marriage between the online community and book club with offline, traditional consumption. <br />Limitations that may be acknowledged within this research method are the respondent rates and particular open-ended questions. The study is mathematically unrepresentative, and through the choice of distribution methods could have experienced a bias within results. Questions utilized in the survey largely aimed to generate qualitative results, but became too general, resulting in anomaly answers that couldn&rsquo;t be explained and short, vague responses. For future reference it would be useful to include more &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; questions for more detail. Overall, the answers presented form fitting stereotypes between readers and non-readers but allowed this study to deduce the popularity of BookTok and the shared or conflicting opinions its content or influence holds (answering both objectives 1 and 4).<br />Conclusion<br />Literature appreciation is deteriorating, some may say. This dissertation is a response to, and a rebut of those scholars who all too quickly judged the internet and easily assumed a position of negativity towards newer and faster developing technologies, for their imminent upheavals towards traditional printed books. <br />Knulst &amp; Kraaykamp (1998, pp. 32-39) offer a plethora of reasons for the decline of reading. They single out the increasing lack of time in daily life, increasing number of leisure alternatives, alongside a rivalry with television, as well as an increasing supply of reading matter which has &ldquo;harmed the appreciation of printed media&rdquo; (1998, p. 39). While Knulst and van den Broek (2003) blame the youths for &ldquo;an ageing interest and a stagnating inflow&rdquo; (2003, p. 223) as they grew up surrounded by television, having never been &ldquo;dependent on printed media&rdquo;, in turn acquiring &ldquo;less reading routine than those socialized before the era of television&rdquo; (2003, p. 225). <br />These &ldquo;premature obituaries&rdquo; (Boorstin, 1984, p. 11) written about books and our appreciation towards print literature reflect the fears surrounding technological development. Technology has been changing our uses and needs for things since its inception (like eBooks and audiobooks becoming the new norm, acknowledged in multiple survey responses). While some scholars believe it to be beneficial, others struggle to adapt their real-world habits onto the online. This dissertation was purposefully framed within the ideas of Technological determinism and Accelerated society to suggest the BookTok community emerged out of necessity and adaptation, to replace the old practices of reading - like technology replaced and improved on existing forms of work and labor within society to better suit this &lsquo;global village&rsquo; world.<br />Technological inventions have been created with the intention to simplify effort and multiply product need and consumption, while Strate (2004, p.7) sees it as an extension to human beings. Regardless of the effect technology stimulates, this dissertation believes society &ldquo;has to adjust and adapt to&rdquo; technology (Hauer, 2017, p. 1) because it has reconfigured the ways we &ldquo;create, distribute and evaluate knowledge, skills and information today&rdquo; (Hauer, 2017, p. 4). We are no longer suited to a non-technological life. This is the essence of the Media Ecology and Technological Determinist theories.<br />An irreversible change is described by Rosa (2003, p. 3) due to the speeding up of &ldquo;technological, economic, social, and cultural processes&rdquo; innovations have brought on. This in turn has sped up the temporal existence, delineating a new societal model called &ldquo;acceleration society&rdquo; (Leccardi, 2003, p. 34). This orders people to adapt and move with the new pace of &lsquo;time&rsquo; and existence or be left behind in the old world. Toffler (1980) highlights this era as &ldquo;the deepest social upheaval and creative restructuring of all time&rdquo;, the &lsquo;Third Wave&rsquo;, long passing the era of the industrial revolution. <br />Now, unlike the scholars fearing the internet&rsquo;s capacity for change, as a &lsquo;thief of time&rsquo; (Osbaldiston, 2013, p. 19), Boorstin (1984, p. 11) explains their fears as amounting to &ldquo;our speedy pace of change tempting us to imagine that new technology buries the old.&rdquo;. It is hard to imagine a world in which the simplification of life will maintain or nurture the values of the past. Osbaldiston (2013, p. 5) equates slowness as reflecting a style of living dislocated from the norms associated with fast capitalism. The limitations of this outlook, however, are its narrow-minded and traditional perceptions of what activities and time spending measures are considered valuable. Conversely, Reddan et al. (2024) acknowledges these values as simply experiencing a shift, into the global village. Book culture emerging online is understood as a &ldquo;process of adaptation&rdquo; (2024, p. 2) and will &ldquo;continue to evolve alongside digital technologies&rdquo; (2024, p. 79). Maziarczyk (2022, p. 111) suggests that we now require a new understanding of &ldquo;full-fledged literacy&rdquo; this can no longer be &ldquo;associated with reading print novels&rdquo;. <br />The dissertation acknowledges the #BookTok community as the new form and totally encompassing form of expression for leisure readers. Survey respondents reveal that being a reader is &ldquo;more accepted now, less shameful&rdquo; (claims R4), &ldquo;popular&rdquo; (R7) and &ldquo;trendy&rdquo; (R17). Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi (2023) identify its &ldquo;positive impacts on the literary community&rdquo; (2023, p. 78), &ldquo;nurturing a vibrant literary culture&rdquo; (2023, p. 80). Like James (2022, p.2), this dissertation shares the sentiment that &ldquo;despite dismal outlooks on the future of print books, a group of young readers online has revitalized the popularity of reading for a new generation.&rdquo;. It single-handedly sparked a 70% increase in reading engagement between 2020 and 2021 (Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi, 2023, p. 76). This confirms a desire for literature among the youths who are utilizing TikTok to promote their hobby further, disbanding earlier mentioned fears for the hobby&rsquo;s decay (answering objectives 1, 2 and 4). <br />Survey respondents revealed common standing assumptions that those not interested in books would not be aware of this online community, while readers are well aware of its existence and relevance for the publishing industry. However, almost all respondents with the app were aware of the community, having interacted with its content. This proves its modern relevance and overwhelming recognition. This study redefines the concepts relating to literature as an extension of Maziarczyk (2022) to argue that traditional notions and opinions have long since shifted into an online world. Not abandoning these values, rather adapting and transitioning into the new village. Having linked to theories of media, objective 3 is answered, identifying effects accelerated culture has made on leisure reading by explaining how people have now reacted to the predictions of scholars.<br />Disproving the negative assumptions of scholars with evidence from secondary literature surrounding BookTok, strengthens objective 2. The qualitative survey analyzed personal opinions about the community and its influence on the participant (readers or not), presenting binary views and yet stereotypical results, these answered objectives 1 and 4 by discovering its popularity and resonance with the reading community. <br />Achieving all four objectives, answers the overarching research question: &ldquo;how has accelerated culture impacted leisure reading?&rdquo;. Understanding the effects of technology on a society has been narrowed to an individual group (of readers) and analyzed through a media case study (BookTok), who&rsquo;s existence already proves a utilization of media for one&rsquo;s own benefit. This opens an avenue for media ecology scholars to explore the mass migration of communities and individuals towards the internet (identified within this study) and further define how one becomes part of these communities. Having analyzed BookTok, this dissertation reveals that a younger generation is intending to maintain the popularity of reading, that what was once percieved as the hub of maintaining knowledge and culture. They are doing so in a modernised way (through the internet and short-form video content) to better suit the needs of individuals today, as a result of accelerated society. </p>",

In the wake of growing societal demands for racial equality, many companies have launched diversity initiatives to project an image of inclusivity. However, these campaigns often serve as superficial gestures rather than driving meaningful structural change. Through the lens of Critical Race Theory, Emotional Labour, Tokenism, and the Inclusion Burden framework, this essay explores how corporate diversity efforts frequently reinforce inequality, perpetuate stereotypes, and place a significant psychological and emotional burden on employees of colour. A satirical media artefact accompanies this essay, critiquing the disconnect between corporate diversity rhetoric and the lived experiences of minority employees. By blending satire with serious critique, the artefact exposes how performative diversity campaigns mask underlying systemic inequalities and fail to create authentic inclusion. The essay argues for more substantive efforts to be made in corporate diversity media campaigns as a move needs to be made beyond token gestures to truly address the structural inequalities and emotional needs of minority employees.<br /> <br /> <br />1. Introduction<br />Ensuring cultural diversity in media is fundamental for promoting inclusive representation and advancing understanding among different segments of society (Chen, 2024). However, this storytelling needs to be truly inclusive in order to tackle systemic inequalities in the workplace. In recent years, equality, diversity, and inclusion (ED&amp;I) campaigns have become an integral part of the public relations and corporate social responsibility strategies of UK businesses. With UK companies striving to align their image with increasing societal demands for racial equality and inclusive workplace environments, they have launched diversity media campaigns that highlight their commitment to inclusion. <br />According to GOV.UK (2024), the UK employs almost twice as many diversity and inclusion workers per 10,000 employees as any other country. However, despite that statistic, the diversity campaigns produced by UK companies often fall into the category of virtue signaling, featuring symbolic gestures such as diverse representation in advertising, diversity training, and awareness weeks. These performative actions are designed to create the illusion of inclusion, but seldom inspire meaningful change at a structural level. In addition, rather than being proactive efforts to foster truly inclusive working environments, many of these campaigns are in fact, reactive, responding to social and political events such as the Black Lives Matter Movement, which have intensified calls for racial equality and justice. The reactive nature of these initiatives has been further emphasized by a survey conducted by CIPD (2022), in which a quarter of employers surveyed stated that their approach to diversity and inclusion is entirely or mostly reactive.<br />Scholars such as Sara Ahmed have called attention to the fact that these campaigns exist solely as performative actions that do little to promote meaningful structural change within organizations (Ahmed, 2012). This lack of meaningful structural change is clearly evident when examining the demographic makeup of the UK workforce. As reported by CIPD (2023), although ethnic minorities make up 12.5% of the UK working-age population, they represent only 10% of the workforce and only 6% of top management positions. Furthermore, they added that Black and ethnic minority (BAME) employees are more likely to have experienced discrimination and felt the need to change aspects of their behaviour in order to integrate into the workplace. <br />In this essay, the Inclusion Burden is introduced as a conceptual framework to explore the invisible labour that corporate diversity media campaigns demand from minority employees. Drawing on Critical Race Theory, Muted Group Theory, and the concepts of emotional labour, and tokenism, this framework explores how corporate diversity initiatives often place an unacknowledged emotional and psychological toll on minority employees. These individuals are oftentimes expected to represent diversity, educate their colleagues, and adjust their behaviour to fit the corporate mould, whilst receiving no genuine support or seeing any consequential structural change. The burden of this additional emotional labour is unseen and unrecognized by organizations, but it can leave minority employees feeling mentally and emotionally exhausted, and at worst, contending with issues such as identity crises as they are forced to present a version of themselves that aligns with the performative diversity agenda of the company. <br />By critically examining the performative nature of these diversity campaigns and employing a multidisciplinary approach to analyze a satirical media artefact created as part of this project to investigate the disparity between corporate discourse and the lived experiences of minority employees focusing on the inclusion burden that minority employees take on, this essay hopes to provide valuable insights into the true implications of these campaigns. Moreover, the essay will explore ways that corporate diversity media campaigns can move beyond performative actions and toward fostering the creation of genuine inclusion in the workplace that addresses both structural inequalities and emotional needs. <br />2. Literature Review<br />2.1 Critical Race Theory<br />Critical Race Theory defines the array of anti-racist principles, knowledge production techniques, and strategies that a collective of legal scholars of colour organized in the 1980s. Their framework seeks to highlight the complex and systemic nature of racism, which operates in ways that surpass overtly racist expressions (Ford &amp; Airhihenbuwa, 2018). The core idea of Critical Race Theory is that race is a social construct, and racism is not born solely out of individual bias and prejudice but is something that has also been ingrained in policies and legal systems (Sawchuk, 2021). Delgado and Stefancic (2017) contend that racism operates at both a systemic and institutional level, which makes it difficult for diversity initiatives to create substantial change unless they address these deep-rooted structures. In addition, Pager and Shepherd (2008) argue that discrimination is systemic, arising from the organization practices, policies, and institutional norms that disadvantage racial minorities. Their research highlights how these structural barriers persist across various sectors and emphasizes the need for transformative polices that address the root causes of racial inequality within institutions. Research from Ashe et al. (2019), illustrates how ethnic minority employee workers suffer due to structural racism in the workplace. A survey of over 5000 minority workers in the UK found that 70% had experienced racial harassment in the workplace in the last five years, 60% had been subject to unfair treatment by their employer because of their race, and over 40% had reported a racist incident and were either ignored, or subsequently been identified as a &ldquo;trouble maker&rdquo;.<br /> <br />2.2 Tokenism<br />Tokenism is a conceptual framework introduced by Rosabeth Kanter in 1977. According to Kanter (1977), individuals who make up 15% or less of a group based on sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or race are considered to hold 'token' status, whereas those comprising 85% or more are classified as the dominant groups. Kanter explored the dynamics between dominant and token groups within organizations, identifying three distinct experiences that tokens encounter. He described these experiences as performance pressure, boundary heightening, and role entrapment. Kanter argued that the expectations placed on tokens regarding their work performance were disproportionately high, a phenomenon he termed performance pressure, which he believed led to increased stress and anxiety for these individuals. Additionally, he noted that dominant groups often exaggerate their cultural bonds, fostering a sense of solidarity that raises barriers against tokens, ultimately disadvantaging them. Lastly, dominant groups tend to generalize about tokens, a tendency rooted in prejudice that reinforces existing stereotypes. This experience, referred to as role entrapment, confines tokens to specific roles assigned to them, while simultaneously imposing expectations for them to conform to these roles within the organization.<br />2.3. Emotional Labour and the Inclusion Burden<br />Arlie Hochschild is a scholar the coined the term, emotional labour, in her 19883 book, &ldquo;The Managed Heart&rdquo;. Hochschild used the term to describe how certain jobs require employees to manage their emotions to fit into a specific role. She explains how employees, particularly those in customer-facing roles, are expected to either fake, or genuinely feel, emotions such as being cheer. This regulation of emotions can take a serious emotional toll on employees, especially when it&rsquo;s not recognized or compensated by their employees. <br />Evans and Moore (2015) conducted a study which involved exploring the experiences of people of colour in elite law schools and the commercial aviation industry in the United States. They observed that individuals of colour endure an unequal burden of emotional labour in comparison to their white peers, as they must confront daily micro-aggressions and dominant ideologies that minimize the importance of &ldquo;race&rdquo; and racism. As a result, employees of colour are motivated to cultivate counter-narratives, in part to safeguard themselves against stigmatization and lessen the potential for severe consequences. Likewise, black men in higher education settings formulate strategies to separate themselves from racism, which often tends to dismiss, trivialize, and reinterpret the realities of everyday racism.<br /> <br />The Inclusion Burden highlights the invisible emotional and psychological toll placed on employees of colour when they are expected to contribute to diversity efforts without adequate support, or without seeing any meaningful changes in the workplace. This additional labour is often unrecognized, uncompensated, and rarely acknowledged by employers.<br /> <br />3. Methodology<br />3.1 Research Questions<br />1. How do UK corporate diversity media campaigns performatively address racial inclusion, and what is the impact of this performativity on minority employees.<br />2. To what extent do corporate diversity media campaigns reflect a genuine commitment to racial equality, or do they serve as symbolic gestures designed to appease stakeholders? <br />3. What are the emotional and psychological consequences for employees of colour who are involved in corporate diversity initiatives, and how do these campaigns contribute the &lsquo;Inclusion Burden&rsquo;. <br />4. How can corporate diversity media campaigns move beyond performative gestures and foster genuine, systemic changes that address both racial inequalities and the emotional well-being of employees.<br /> <br />3.1.2. Research Objectives<br />1. To critically examine the performative nature of UK corporate diversity media campaigns. <br />2. To explore the emotional toll placed on minority employees through diversity campaigns. <br />3. To analyse the implications of performative diversity campaigns on the lived experiences of employees of colour. <br />4. To provide practical recommendations for creating meaningful, structural changes within corporate diversity initiatives.<br /> <br />3.2. Research Approach<br />This essay uses a qualitative approach, relying on secondary research to explore the performative nature of corporate diversity campaigns and their impact on minority employees. Due to time constraints, primary data collection was not feasible; therefore, existing studies, industry reports, and academic sources will be analysed to draw insights into how corporate diversity initiatives manifest in real-world corporate settings. <br />3.3 Satirical Media Artefact<br />A satirical media artefact has been made to accompany this essay. The aim of the satirical media artefact is to critically engage with the frameworks explored in the essay. Using satire, the artefact highlights the superficiality and performative nature of corporative diversity campaigns, and initiatives such as awareness weeks and superficial diversity efforts. Satire was chosen due to its ability to challenge societal norms and power structures by blending humour with serious critique to get people to question what they&rsquo;ve always accepted as truth (Mcclennen, 2023). By exaggerating the ridiculousness of these initiatives, the video aims to provoke the analysis of corporate diversity media campaigns and expose the gap between the rhetoric of those campaigns and the lived experiences of ethnic minority employees. <br />The media artefact is analysed within the Inclusion Burden framework, serving as a creative tool to expose the underlying performative nature of corporate diversity efforts and the emotional toll placed on employees of colour. It also serves as a critical tool to visualize how these campaigns might impact minority employees psychologically and emotionally, reinforcing the idea that diversity initiatives often prioritize appearances over real change. <br />3.4. Gaps in Existing Literature<br />Whilst much research has been conducted into the intended outcomes of corporate diversity media campaigns, there is a significant gap in research regarding the way in which these campaigns often fall into the territory of virtue signaling, failing to result in meaningful changes within organizations. A satirical media artefact has been created in accompaniment of this essay and will be used as a critical method to examine the performative nature of UK corporate diversity media campaigns. An additional critical gap in the existing research is a lack of focus on the emotional toll that these campaigns have on ethnic minority employees. Many existing studies devote attention to the outward effects of the campaigns, exploring whether changes in diversity can be seen through increased representation in the workplace, but they fail to acknowledge the emotional and psychological burden placed on minority employees by these campaigns. This essay aims to address these gaps by asking the critical question: Are UK corporate diversity media campaigns truly empowering employees of colour, or are they simply performative actions designed to appease stakeholders, that reinforce stereotypes, perpetuate inequality, and place a significant psychological toll on the same employees they claim to support? <br />3.5 Limitations<br />While secondary research offers valuable insights, it cannot fully capture the lived experiences of minority employees in corporate setting. Future studies could benefit from primary data collection, such as interviews or surveys with employees of colour, to provide a more nuanced understanding of the emotional and psychological toll that diversity initiatives place on the same employees that they claim to support. <br />4. Analysis <br />Many UK corporate diversity media campaigns display outward-facing goals of fostering inclusivity and diversity; however, these campaigns often fail to inspire, or introduce, any substantial, meaningful change within organizations. Drawing on the Inclusion Burden framework, alongside Critical Race Theory, Emotional Labour, and Tokenism, the analysis focuses critically examines the performative nature of corporate diversity media campaigns in the UK and explores how these campaigns impact the psychological and emotional wellbeing of minority employees. <br />4.1. The Performative Nature of Corporate Diversity Media Campaigns<br />In the context of UK businesses, corporate diversity media campaigns are often launched as part of public relations strategies aimed at enhancing brand reputation and aligning with broader societal demands for racial equality. With that said, these campaigns are often performative in nature, According to GOV.UK (2024), reviews of the latest evidence found high workplace spending on EDI initiatives but inadequate results and a poor understanding of what works, and what doesn&rsquo;t work.

(2024) argue that many organizations engage in performative diversity efforts, using superficial actions aimed at enhancing public image rather than achieving substantive change. It can be seen why corporations have made such a huge effort to push an image of commitment to diversity in their campaigns. Studies consistently show that diverse companies are more innovative and profitable, and consumers are more likely to support brands that prioritize inclusivity. Top Design Firms (2020) found that 67% of consumers are at least somewhat likely to make a repeat purchase from a brand they believe to be committed to diversity and inclusion; moreover, if two brands carry the same product, 34% would consider each brand&rsquo;s commitment to diversity and inclusion when making their final purchasing decision.<br /> <br />4.2. The Inclusion Burden: Emotional Labour and Psychological Toll <br />The Inclusion Burden framework, developed as part of this essay, is critical in understanding the emotional and psychological toll that corporate diversity initiatives place on employees of colour. Whilst these campaigns are oftentimes framed as proactive steps towards inclusivity, they frequently fall into the category of performative actions; simply providing companies with an outward-facing image of diversity without cultivating real, systemic change. An article from Nance-Nash (2020) highlights how corporate diversity efforts unfairly place the responsibility of these initiatives on employees of colour. Employees are often expected to draft anti-racism statements, participate in diversity strategy meetings, and act as the &ldquo;voice&rdquo; and &ldquo;face&rdquo; of their respective racial communities. Furthermore, many of these employees may not have any desire to take part in these campaigns but are forced to do so by their employers. Despite this, they are not provided additional emotional and/or mental support, nor additional compensation, leading to an emotional burden that exacerbates their daily work responsibilities.<br /> <br />Within the context of corporate diversity campaigns, minority employees are frequently tasked with representing diversity, educating colleagues on racial issues, and navigating racism themselves. They are expected to perform these roles while maintaining professionalism and composure, despite facing emotional exhaustion and psychological strain. This emotional labour, however, is oftentimes unacknowledged by organizations, leading to a situation in which minority employees must shoulder the weight of diversity efforts without receiving any support, recognition, or seeing any meaningful changes within the workplace. The Inclusion Burden reflects how these employees must balance the emotional labour of representing diversity with their professional duties, resulting in feelings of burnout, frustration, and mental fatigue. <br />The Inclusion Burden reflects how minority employees are often forced to shoulder the weight of corporate diversity efforts, both emotionally and psychologically, whilst companies fail to implement meaningful changes or create structural change. The additional burden of managing these extra tasks without formal acknowledgement, adjustment to workload, or necessary support, leads to mental, and emotional, exhaustion, and alienation. Ultimately, this reinforces the marginalization of employees of colour within the corporate structure. Through the lens of this framework, corporate diversity media campaigns serve as superficial, performative efforts that mask ongoing structural inequalities whilst placing an emotional and psychological burden on minority employees.<br /> <br />4.3. Tokenism<br />Tokenism in corporate diversity media campaigns can exacerbate feelings of isolation and alienation among employees of colour. Tokenism is especially visible in how organizations use their media strategies to present a diverse image to the public. Companies often rely on symbolic representations, such as showcasing a small number of minority employees in advertisements, internal and external corporate diversity campaigns, promotional videos, or social media content. These gestures, whilst seemingly progressive, oftentimes fall short of addressing deeper systemic issues within the company. In this context, tokenism is not only about having a minority employee in the workplace, but about the ways in which the employee is portrayed in the companies&rsquo; diversity campaigns. In these campaigns, employers use ethnic minority employees to construct a narrative of inclusivity without challenging the underlying structures of power and inequality. <br />This lack of genuine representation and empowerment can exacerbate the emotional and psychological toll of being tokenized, contributing to the Inclusion Burden described earlier. Tokenism, when combined with the emotional labour of performing to fit the corporate mould of diversity, can leave ethnic minority employees feeling mentally and emotionally exhausted, with their efforts being adopted solely for public relations and profit purposes, rather than leading to any substantive change in organizational structures.</p>\n<p>4.4. DiverseInWork: Satirical Media Artefact<br />To support the exploration of the performative nature of corporate diversity media campaigns, a satirical media artefact was utilized as a critical tool to highlight the disconnect between the diversity rhetoric that corporations present and the lived experiences of minority employees. The artefact uses satire and exaggeration to call attention to how diversity campaigns often focus on symbolic gestures, such as awareness days, whilst failed to address the systemic inequalities implanted within organizational structures. <br />Gao et al. (2024) argue that media has the ability to change cultural landscapes, as well as shape our identities, values, and comprehension of the world around us. According to Rona (2023), advertising that perpetuates racial stereotypes can contribute to the marginalization and discrimination of certain racial and ethnic groups. With that known, diversity media campaigns created by corporations assist in perpetuating the same stereotypes that they claim to be working toward abolishing. For example, the video highlighted racial awareness days. These days oftentimes result in the minimizing of vast cultures to one symbol, such as South Asia being reduced to just samosas and curry even though the region is made up of multiple different countries that eat a variety of different foods, and speak a variety of different languages. Imagery such as this in corporate diversity campaigns only serves to perpetuate the same stereotypes and microagressions that minorities already face on a daily basis in the workplace. <br />Furthermore, Wingfield and Alston (2013) developed the concept of racial tasks, which helps in understanding how minority employees are often expected to shoulder the responsibility for diversity initiatives. They contend that there are three types of tasks: ideological, interactional, and physical. Minority employees are frequently asked to represent diversity, mediate between different racial groups, and perform roles that appear to promote inclusivity without contributing to any significant structural change. These expectations are unfairly placed on minority employees with any additional support, financial compensation, adjustments to workload, or recognition, which results in a weighty emotional and physical burden being placed on them. <br />This video highlights these racial tasks by exaggerating how employees of colour are persistently called upon to attend diversity related meetings, and be at the forefront of diversity campaigns which border on racist themselves, In addition, employees oftentimes find themselves expected to offer guidance on racial issues whilst maintaining professionalism and composure, and balancing their regular work duties. Wingfield and Alston (2013) argue that these tasks are unseen but play a significant role in maintaining the racial hierarchies within these organizations. With the framing of diversity efforts as the responsibility of ethnic minority employees, corporations are able to put forward the appearance of inclusivity without making any substantial structural changes.<br /> <br />5. Conclusion<br />To conclude, corporate diversity media campaigns are often presented as progressive efforts towards racial inclusion, but in many cases, they fall into the category of performative, virtue signalling. Although many corporations are adopting outward-facing commitments due to <br />Through the Inclusion Burden, this essay has critically examined how these campaigns not only perpetuate inequality, but also impose an emotional and psychological toll on those they claim to support. Minority employees are expected to bear the weight of these initiatives, often without compensation, support, or recognition, which leads to stress, burnout, and a sense of isolation. <br />The satirical media artefact created for this project offers a creative reflection of these performative actions, parodying the superficiality of corporate diversity efforts. By using satire, the artefact highlights the absurdity of diversity campaigns that do not translate into real, systemic change. It is hoped that this combination of critical analysis and creative critique provides valuable insights into the limitations of corporate diversity campaigns and encourages a shift towards more meaningful efforts. However, this requires a move beyond performative gestures, which first requires a fundamental shift in organizational culture; a shift that truly values diversity in substance, not just in appearance. <br />Ultimately, this essay highlights the importance of not only recognizing diversity, but actively creating a truly inclusive and supportive environment for all employees. Companies must go beyond treating diversity media campaigns as simple &ldquo;tick box&rdquo; exercises and ensure that these campaigns highlight, and bring to light, structural inequalities as a way of inspiring structural change, and providing real opportunities for minority employees rather than just more work and emotional labour. It is only through a genuine commitment to these efforts that organizations can begin to make substantial progress in dismantling the structural barriers that continue to perpetuate inequality in the workplace.<br /> <br /> <br />&nbsp;</p>",

This is with a focus on the case analysis of feminist Hashtags. This is because the online space has become necessary for protest and conversation in the online age of feminist movements. Drawing from a discourse analysis of popular feminist hashtags such as #MeToo, #HeForShe, #YesAllWomen, #WomenRightsMatter, and #WomensMarch, the paper dissected how the hashtags construct, propagate, and reinforce the narratives of feminism. Hashtags work well because they're strong discursive tools that allow users to build networks, share personal stories, and subvert mainstream gender expectations. The study analyzes the double role played by hashtags in raising awareness and mobilizing action and discusses their limitations in taking online participation to lasting social and policy change. The research method employed in the study was qualitative discourse analysis of online posts using the selected feminist hashtags from 2013 to 2024. The research discovered that online action has made the popularization of feminist discourse mainstream to a much larger audience because some campaigns like #MeToo have gone global and elicited institutional responses. The research study also explored barriers to online action in the form of performative allyship, slacktivism, and the pervasiveness of online harassment, primarily targeting feminist activists and gender-based violence survivors. Case instances in the form of #MeToo and #HeForShe demonstrate the promise held in online campaigns to mobilize discourse and institutionally-related support but the promise to be criticized on the basis of sustainability, inclusion, and quantifiable impacts. Hashtag feminist critique stands in the way of encouraging shallowness in policy-making because hashtag feminist discourse might not account for and encompass marginal subjects such as non-binary subjects and subjects with no online inclusion. The research adds to feminist scholarship by highlighting the necessity of a hybrid model of activism, combining online tactics and offline protests. It suggests that future campaigns must be built on a foundation of intersectionality, inclusivity, and long-term commitment to maintain momentum and ensure change in the physical world. The research further calls for stronger content moderation policies and support systems to neutralize cyberbullying and shield digital activists. Lastly, the research confirmed that social media has democratized feminist activism by extending participation and voice to formerly excluded groups. Yet, suppose online feminist mobilizations are to be fully effective. In that case, they should extend beyond raising awareness to cause policy and social norm changes and bring deep changes to the system. The research adds to the new work on online feminist mobilizations and gives practical suggestions for future feminist mobilizations dealing with online mobilizations and offline effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. Introduction and Rationale<br />Social media has revolutionized the modern feminism activism field to influence the emerging generations in leading discussions and making effective social change. Women&rsquo;s rights in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were won through political activism, including strikes and protests, and other common activism. This is because the advancement of the digital era has shifted feminism from physical spaces to digital platforms such as Twitter (now X) and Instagram. Social media technology enables individuals and groups to engage in gender equality dialogue and dismantle structural oppression to empower marginalized voices (Crossley, 2015).<br />The digital feminist movement emerged through feminism which defines how women incorporate narrative construction in gender equality advocacy on the internet. The use of #YesAllWomen, #MeToo and #WomenRights hashtags have provided backing both from online communications between users and also from social-political movements in actual life (Jackson, 2018). Having started in November 2017, the Global #MeToo campaign gave women a voice to share their ordeal at the hands of workplace abuse resulting in international debates on sexual misconduct and equal opportunities for women at the workplace. Digital activism has prompted lawmakers to reconsider and revise laws concerning sexual violence cases (Rodrigues, 2016). Through increasing societal awareness and subjecting femicide and GBV to public scrutiny, the Argentine initiative #NiUnaMenos guided Argentine activists towards transforming GBV into an international issue.<br />While social activism has brought feminist movements out in the open due to social platforms, Digital activism&rsquo;s viability is still under debate. Engaging social media to create discussion on gender violence enhances its effectiveness but does not yield a significant reduction in cases of gender violence. In a statistical study done by Caldeira (2024), it is understood that in Ireland, women and girls were killed by members of their families involved with their intimate partners, with domestic violence accounting for 63% of these deaths, 140 women and girls have been killed between 1996 and 2024. These evidence on statistics of Caldeira shows that new media activism increases engagement but requires other ingredients for the development of social and policy change. According to Ott (2018), social change work in gender relations can only be achieved through media activism and a parallel action plan in real life.<br />Three significant components define the success of feminist hashtag activism and they are inclusiveness, clear targets and physical manifestation of digital action (Keller 2019). The inclusiveness of a digital space determines the extent of participation of minorities because intersectionalism requires the representation of diverse groups (Kanai, 2020). Overall, the movement gains higher effectiveness when it addresses its goals to a certain extent because goal specificity keeps the efforts focused. Their transition from the digital platform to real-life activism contributes to making the discourse in the online sphere outcome in policy changes and alteration of people&rsquo;s behaviours (Rogan and Budgeon, 2018). Those who are without digital technologies get subjected to barriers that halt their inclusion in feminist discourses (Toffoletti and Thorpe, 2018).<br />Moreover, the understanding of the impact of social media on the function of social justice and gender equality is predicated on women&rsquo;s ability to interact with feminist theory and digital activism. This study seeks to find out how the emergence of feminist hashtag activism after the #2013 has impacted women on social networks while also testing the capacity of hashtag activism in countering sexism. There is a need to also identify the limitations of social media advocacy and undertake a research effort to establish ways through which the concept of digital activism can be incorporated with traditional approaches for the next phase of advocacy towards social justice (Weber and Davis, 2020). Focusing on it, the analysis aims to discuss the modern behaviour of the discourse that defines feminism in social networks and its impact on the activity of modern occupation movements.</p>\n<p>&emsp;<br />2. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework<br />2.1 Introduction to Feminist Theory in the Digital Age<br />Feminist theory has evolved from the late nineteenth-century issues as the suffragettes battling for the right to vote and for women&rsquo;s rights immediately after being granted a voice along with the current issues in the sociological and political discourses, including reproductive rights, workplace discriminations, and gender violence (Rodrigues, 2016; Crossley, 2015). Facebook and any other social media platform within contemporary society facilitate positive activism by reaching out to the communities and launching discussions and other actions (Keller, 2019; Jou&euml;t, 2018).<br />Digital feminism relies on social connections to foster multinational and cross-cultural feminism debate and interactions (Ott, 2018, as cited in Kanai, 2020). On the basis of movements like; #MeToo, #HeForShe and others such as #YesAllWomen, the usage of hashtags in social media platforms enables the connection of global feminism as noted by Rogan and Budgeon (2018) and Weber and Davis (2020). In this way, via social media, such feminists subvert the dominant gender narratives to come up with other forms of feminism as Toffoletti &amp; Thorpe (2018) and Thorpe et al (2017) argue. Video feminism responds to present day matters; it makes new meanings regarding gender equality, simultaneously illuminating how people have different experiences of their situations (Turley &amp; Fisher, 2018). In the analysis, the impact of feminism to digital activism is examined and it is known that digital activism causes current feminism and diversification of feminism discourse in modern society.<br />2.2 Feminist Theory: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives<br />2.2.1 Origins and Evolution of Feminist Theory<br />Feminist advocacy appeared when women were denied their dignified participation in society due to the existing patriarchal structures. The first wave of feminism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was majorly characterized by the fight for women's suffrage and property rights as stated by Rodrigues (2016). In the 1970s feminists expanded the platform to include reproductive rights and discrimination at the workplace as well as violence against women as they embraced socialist and radical feminism to fight oppression (Keller, 2019; Crossley, 2015). The feminist movement of the nineties marked the beginning of the third wave of feminism which embraced the concept of intersectionality that looks at how women&rsquo;s oppression and subordination affect other elements such as race sexuality and situational status (Jackson, 2018; Toffoletti &amp; Thorpe, 2018). The fourth wave of feminism emphasizes amplifying progressive activism, and this is mostly done through the use of new/ digital technology especially social media in the modern world as indicated by Caldeira (2023) and Jou&euml;t (2018). Feminist activism goes global through social media platforms for the creation of awareness and the purpose of soliciting gender-based violence (Ott, 2018; Weber and Davis, 2020). The use of Hashtags #MeToo, #HeForShe, and #YesAllWomen in social media has transformed the feminist discourses since it creates unity among feminists from all over the world and also strengthens different viewpoints (Thorpe, Toffoletti, )&amp; Bruce, 2017; Rogan and Budgeon, 2018; Turley and Fisher, 2018). Feminism utilizes strategies on new technologies to address changes in culture while continually fighting the issue of gender inequality.<br />2.2.2 Feminist Digital Activism<br />Feminist movements in the current society have transformed formerly localized activity into progressive interaction via cyberspace. Social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, among the others that have emerged recently, remain some of the most effective platforms to help feminist activists reach out to more people. In the participation of social media, any person without any restrictions alongside women and girls can perform feminism Storer and Rodriguez (2020). Hashtags related to any feminist movement work as a call to arms that open the area of activity and unite people of any gender willing to participate. According to Boling (2020), digital feminism enhances visibility, and there is controversy about its impact on actual social and policy changes. Online feminism is criticized for being superficial because, at times, it reduces weighty issues of feminism to dwindling trends. The increase of feminism in digital activism through social media has enhanced twenty-first-century advocacy by providing quick access to platforms and opportunities for gender equality while dismantling patriarchal norms.<br />2.3 Feminist Hashtags as Discursive Activism<br />2.3.1 Hashtag Feminism: Defining the Concept<br />Hashtag feminism refers to how strategic hashtags social media users use adoption to create feminist activism. Hashtags effectively search and link the content that leans toward the feminists&rsquo; interest through compiled keywords that form a coherent but dispersed online community support, as explained by Clark (2016). The well-known sources of online feminism incorporate hashtags, such as #MeToo, #HeForShe, and #YesAllWomen, making it clear for people to be involved in the feminist dialogue. Boling (2020) says that such hashtags facilitate identity and networking between the feminist activists as the activists share knowledge and support one another. The elimination of geographical localization through hashtag feminism assists in elevating the feminist narratives for everyone across different regions. Austin et al. (2023) pointed out that, the #MeToo hashtag raised awareness on the issue of sexual harassment in the global society where women of all diversity brought to light their ordeal. Critics of hashtag feminism and other forms of feminism say so because there is enhanced visibility of women's issues through them. Still, most of the time, virtual activism does not go far enough to cause tangible changes.<br />2.3.2 Hashtag Activism and Feminist Identity<br />Using hashtag movements in community activism allows for new ways of social change on how feminist identity is viewed during the discourse. It is through the various social media platforms that people can be able to connect with others on matters that relate to feminism, hence fostering the development of their digital feminist self (Crossley, 2015, p.19). The hashtags such as #MeToo, #HeForShe, and #YesAllWomen created the opportunity for people to share their stories and demanded change by Jackson (2018). In the context of politics, Ott (2018) pointed out that hashtags help feminists fight against political systems for activism.</p>\n<p>Keller (2019) asserted that as a result of social media, users can transform the stories of feminism by being engaged in online communication. Jou&euml;t has revealed back in 2018 that the digital activity of the Feminist discourse breaks the geography and thus unites individuals of different cultural contexts. According to Toffoletti and Thorpe (2018), digital feminism provides intersectionality, thus allowing many voices to be heard actively.</p>\n<p>While acknowledging the benefits of digital feminism, Weber and Davis (2020) discuss the dangers of engaging in activism since activists are harassed in online forums. Thorpe, Toffoletti, and Bruce (2017) provide that the activeness of hashtags which is on the internet works best when they are combined with other actions on the ground to implement certain changes to the policies in place. Based on Rogan and Budgeon (2018), due to the emergence of digital activism, concerns relating to feminist knowledge have turned into ordinary discussions hence compelling the policymakers to observe issues relating to gender-based violence. The authors Turley and Fisher in the article &lsquo;Examining the Intersection of Feminism and Digital Media: A Case of Digital Feminist Activism&rsquo; describe the purpose of digital feminism as challenging hegemonic media narratives while creating new spaces for feminism and resistances. Specifically, through hashtag activism, the modern feminist identity emerged in the digital age social media as a way for group identification as well as personal voice during the digital age. Based on the flow of this approach the authors argue that the success of the suggested practices is not in the social media interactions but in the continuation of further actions that take place outside the virtual environment to bring the envisaged changes into reality.<br />2.4 Feminist Theoretical Frameworks in Digital Activism<br />2.4.1 Cyberfeminism<br />The integration of digital technologies in the activism of the women&rsquo;s movement led to the development of Cyberfeminism as a movement. This example shows how to apply social networks on the internet to dismantle the power relations between genders and create new platforms for discussing feminism (Ott, 2018). According to Crossley (2015), cyberfeminism is a concept that peruses technology as an apparatus that overthrows male-dominated power systems to allow womanly forces to stage a comeback against subjugation. According to Jou&euml;t (2018), cyberfeminism is beneficial to fourth-wave feminism courtesy of the integration of online actions in any tantamount feminist endeavour. There are social sites which allow the sharing of ideas which in this case makes marginalized opinionated to be aired according to Keller 2019. According to Toffoletti and Thorpe (2018), cyberfeminism is used to support intersectional approaches because it allows various groups that wish to express themselves.<br />Cyberfeminism has a twofold element that was explained by Weber and Davis (2020) since it is used in activist work and at the same time entails cyberspace harassment of feminists. Cyberfeminism is not confined to social media influence since it provides a direction for writing digital literature and scholarly writing as well as art (Thorpe, Toffoletti and Bruce, 2017). According to Rogan and Budgeon, (2018), mainstream media of women&rsquo;s resistance can be attributed to cyberfeminist activity. Thus, cyberfeminism also does not stand still, and it shapes its future by reflecting technological changes and other cultural shifts, according to Turley and Fisher (2018). Cyberfeminists employ these technologies to augment activism, fight against systemic injustices, and alter the nature of feminists&rsquo; struggle in the contemporary age.<br />2.5 Case Analysis of Feminist Hashtags<br />2.5.1 #MeToo Movement<br />#MeToo showed through feminism that hashtags advance the telling of victims&rsquo; stories and fight against the endemic practices of sexual harassment. Tarana Burke initiated and started using the #MeToo hashtag in 2006; however, it came out in the global limelight only in 2017 when there were sexual abuse cases against performing artists and makers of Hollywood. Mueller et al., (2021) said that through the #MeToo movement, women shared their rape and harassment experiences and did so in defiance of cultural and national boundaries. It stimulated a high level of public awareness towards issues of gender-based violence, and outcomes are seen at the highest levels with celebrities losing their jobs and laws changing. Didactic Framework points out that still, neither the Speak Out Act passed in 2022 to hinder the use of non-disclosure agreements in cases of sexual assault nor this nor the previous change has put an end to systemization. The #MeToo movement shows that social media&rsquo;s ability to reignite cultural processes is still problematic in converting them into sustainable legal and cultural changes.<br />2.5.2 #HeForShe Campaign<br />The #HeForShe campaign, which was created by UN Women in 2014, is an example of digital activism that employs male participation in discussions on gender equality. Social media is a subculture deemed instrumental in pushing for the advancement of feminism, as postulated by Crossley (2015) and Jackson (2018). The availability of various online platforms makes more people embrace feminism to bring in diverse perceptions of feminism, thus giving it a platform to receive criticisms and challenges (Ott, 2018; Weber &amp; Davis, 2020). Research findings show that the use of hashtag activism with the help of #HeForShe solidifies one&rsquo;s company and identity within the digital space (Jou&euml;t, 2018; Storer &amp; Rodriguez, 2020). Although digital feminist spaces are opening up for participation, journalistic reflections on digital performativity give scholars reason to note what can be called symbolic performances of allyship that do not speak of tangible action (Rogan Clark &amp; Budgeon, 2018; Keller, 2019).</p>\n<p>Social media is mainly incorporated into the framework of the campaign under investigation, reflecting modern trends in feminist activism due to the possibilities that Twitter and Instagram open for feminism (Li et al., 2021; Caldeira, 2023). In specific, the literature on corporate co-option is viewed as a threat because the feminist messages may be diluted in the name of profits (Rodrigues, 2016; Toffoletti &amp; Thorpe, 2018). Despite this, the authors go further to argue that offline engagement is critical for the impact of digital feminism, as evidenced by #HeForShe, wherein social activism leads to more support. This assertion should be made to ensure any advancement yields a significant advancement in sociological science.<br />2.5.3 #YesAllWomen and #WomenMarch<br />The hashtag #YesAllWomen also appeared in 2014 in connection with mass shootings inspired by the hatred of women. The hashtag was used as a trend in which women shared their stories concerning sexism, harassment, and discrimination. Flecha (2021) also points out that #YesAllWomen provided women with the way to report on the constant aggressions they face and to organized themselves, so they empowered together. Likewise, the &lsquo;#WomenMarch&rsquo; hashtag encouraged millions of women worldwide to come out onto the streets demanding their rights and justice. As Simone pointed out in her 2019 article, such campaigns demonstrate social media's assumed potential and benefits in promoting global and collective activism among females. Boling (2020) noted that these movements gained much attention and participation, but many of them make it difficult to sustain movements and implement policies. <br />2.6 Challenges and Critiques of Hashtag Feminism<br />2.6.1 Performative Activism and Slacktivism<br />Some of the criticisms leveled against hashtag feminism include the following: problems due to trends and gadget, such as slacktivism and clicktivism refer to the current inclinations by the society to support a worthy cause through making an online post yet they lack true intent behind the act. According to Clark (2016), such an action as sharing or liking feminism on social media platform produces an impression of activism hence creating slacktivism. Boling (2020) goes further and notes that this type of engagement can water down the movements that are fighting for women&rsquo;s rights since gaining visibility online does not necessarily result in social or political improvement. Campaigns like #HeForShe, for example, have been described as tokenistic or obfuscating, because they failed to come up with measures that would hold the men involved accountable (Rodrigues, 2016). Campaigning, though, still has its trouble, and hashtag feminism is not a panacea for this problem; therefore, it is important to consider the further subtleties of activism and to work on making the spectators not only discuss the issue on Facebook or send pictures of the marches they attended to Twitter.<br />2.6.2 Online Harassment and Backlash<br />Hashtags used for advocacy for gender experience adverse reactions whereby the campaigners are harassed by trolls who also target the so-called &lsquo;feminist activists.&rsquo; During the #MeToo movement, Rose McGowan and journalists who documented cases of sexual violence faced severe trolling with threats included. Flecha (2021) replies that symmetrical aggression is second-degree sexual harassment perpetuated on people who support gender violence victims, such as lawyers, journalists, and activists. Cyber harassment discourages women from engaging in activism any further because, like in ordinary societies, once again, women are silenced. At the same time, digital media is prevented from taking an active part in supplementing the fight for women&rsquo;s rights.</p>\n<p>Cyber harassment is particularly aimed at women and Caldeira (2023) pointed out that this action enlarges the disparity within the feminist protest. The activists complained of doxxing accompanied by threats during the #SayHerName campaign that forced them to stop participating in the campaign. Publiczi has cited that women in leadership and supporters of gender equality, including Malala Yousafzai and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have experienced terrible times through online harassment. Nevertheless, these challenges hinder the ability of the feminist movement to maintain that social networks have not entirely lost their function in Women&rsquo;s rights activism due to self-censorship and protection of activists on online platforms. Measures to protect such stances in using digital activism ought to be upheld because the current form of writing is necessary for preserving &amp; sustaining female activism online.<br />2.7 The Role of Discourse Analysis in Studying Feminist Hashtags<br />Discourse analysis is considered a suitable approach for investigating feminist hashtags. As stated in Van Zyl et al (2021), discourse analysis can be defined as the study of language, stories, and power relations within the framework of the digital feminism discourse[s]. When researchers examine a particular set of posts that can be linked to some unified label, a pattern of meaning, resistance, or identity construction emerges. Rodrigues (2016) notes from the paper that discourse analysis effectively shows how feminism is work, engagement, and struggle in CMC spaces. The analysis of the uploaded data demonstrates that it was marked by the popular hashtags #HeForShe and #MeToo, which enhanced the discourse identification, brought together the participants, and exposed them to haters (Simone, 2019). The discourse analytical approach can thus help scholars understand the subtleties of Ferrari&rsquo;s prevention of &lsquo;post-feminism&rsquo; theory and the opportunities and concerns that come with the use of social media for driving change.<br />2.8 Conclusion<br />The concept of formulating female popularity with the formulation of identity stems from the tenets of the feminist theory. With the help of hashtag feminism, users support global feminism combined with the raising of marginalized voices and the struggle against traditional chauvinist structures in social media. The women&rsquo;s liberation goals of women get a chance as well as achievements by the Social Media movements, which include &lsquo;Me Too,&rsquo; &lsquo;He For She&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Yes All Women.&rsquo; However, critiques of digital feminism highlight limitations such as performative activism, online harassment, and the ephemeral nature of hashtag campaigns. To overcome these challenges, there is need to integrate strategies that ensure focus on virtual communication while also implementing physical actions. More research should be done regarding digital and physical activism, as this will examine the role of social media in complementing traditional activism. Discourse and networked feminist theory are critical to improving the understanding of the adaptation of feminist theory in present digital society.<br />3. Research Questions and Objectives<br />Social media hashtags are noted to be the modern way feminist theory has advanced in online discussion but still achieved less regarding women&rsquo;s empowerment as they do not amount to any action. To explore this area and come up with more focused results, there must be some key research questions that the study will focus on and key research objectives to be met. The first research question for the topic is: Has social media, through the feminist hashtags, helped to advance feminist theory, and do they achieve any positive action toward women&rsquo;s rights? The second research question is: How does social media help users spread feminist ideas and conversations, and how does this differ from traditional methods? How effective are social media feminist hashtags in influencing the public perceptions of gender roles and social norms in society? These research questions can only be explored with some objectives the research will seek to achieve by answering. Therefore, the research objectives that this research study will seek to achieve include the following. To find out whether social media, through the feminist hashtags, has helped to advance feminist theory and do they achieve any positive action toward women&rsquo;s rights. Establish how social media helps users spread feminist ideas and conversations and how this differs from traditional methods. To find out how effective social media feminist hashtags influence public perceptions of gender roles and social norms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&emsp;<br />4. Research Methods and Research Study Design<br />The study conducted qualitative research on the existing feminist hashtags on social networking sites such as Twitter and Instagram. Selecting discourse analysis as the primary research methodology enabled research to look at the social and linguistic construction of meaning that feminist movements convey via hashtags. In the work of Van Zyl et al. (2021), it is mentioned that discourse analysis offers the researchers&rsquo; ways of studying language-driven communication in order to understand how language constructs social worlds. Discourse analysis allowed for the discussion of how the feminist hashtags contributed to the development of feminist theory and feminism activism on social media.<br />This study used an exploratory research design to analyse how the use of hashtags enriches feminist activism and the discussions that a feminist movement entails. The design was suitable for the study because it allowed the categorization of hashtag content by interpreting the hidden messages and identifying themes that depicted trends in feminists&rsquo; discussions on social media. <br />4.1 Data Collection Methods<br />Selection of Hashtags<br />The study data was collected through active feminist hashtags on the two main platforms, Twitter and Instagram. The collected data was limited from 2013 and based on trends from that period. Social media hashtags were selected based on three criteria related to their feminist content, global use, and ability to mobilize users socially. Specific six hashtags were selected as research subjects, including the origination hashtag #HeForShe, #MeToo, #WomensMarch, #YesAllWomen, #YesAllMen, and #WomenRightsMatter. These social media hashtags represented all others aspects of the feminist movements such as gender equality, sexual harassment and gender-based violence.<br />These hashtags were identified based on the research studies by Keller (2019) and Van Zyl et al. (2021). The #HeForShe concept was presented by Marcus Watson in a United Nations campaign where he encouraged males to take part in gender equality. The #MeToo movement opened an international platform for women to stand up against sexual abuse and harassment in 2017. The #WomensMarch of 2024 was followed by activism for women&rsquo;s rights and equality, as well as the #YesAllWomen and #YesAllMen movements that fight against structural sexism and women&rsquo;s rape.<br />Data Sources and Platforms<br />The data sources in this study were Twitter and Instagram platforms. Feminist hashtags appeared regularly on Twitter and Instagram to both gain backing and distribute information about female matters. Twitter serves as a prominent hub for feminist activism according to Keller (2019) so it was chosen as the key research platform. The visual aspect of Instagram made it possible for feminists to convey their messages effectively using pictures and print that intensified both the persuasiveness and emotional content.<br />The study analyzed Twitter and Instagram posts containing the selected hashtags that were accessible to the public. The analysis included a review of public Instagram posts from 2013 to 2024, showcasing fundamental feminist campaigns throughout their historical development. Selection criteria determined the posts due to their focus on feminist principles that promoted gender equality and empowerment against sexual harassment.<br />4.2 Data Analysis Methods<br />In order to analyze present language patterns, thematic elements, and social meanings, Discourse analysis of selected platform content was done. This study aimed to establish how feminism messages were articulated when conveyed via Twitter hashtags alongside Twitter tweets in association with the text components of the Instagram platform. The major aspects that are highlighted within the feminist movement include equal rights for both sexes and women&rsquo;s rights to be empowered without violence or any form of gender discrimination.<br />In analyzing the data collected, the research method used coding to identify patterns and themes related to hashtags in the discussion. The researcher performed this task manually to ensure adequate understanding of the collected data. Manual coding appears as a suitable approach in discourse analysis as highlighted by Van Zyl et al. (2021) because it allows researchers to capture meanings that automated processes might not pick. A discourse analysis was conducted, which involved analyzing the frequency of user interactions through Twitter in terms of Retweets, Replies &amp; Likes, and Instagram in terms of Comments &amp; Likes. The analytical approach enhanced understanding of how the online community shared and protected feminism. <br />4.3 Ethical Considerations<br />Ethical principles formed an essential foundation for conducting research activities. Anonymity prevailed among social media users from start to finish during the examination period. The research used anonymized user names and personal information removal in all analysis steps to safeguard individual privacy according to Internet research ethical principles (Li et al., 2021). The research only examined publicly visible content because private account material was excluded for privacy reasons.<br />The research followed ethical principles through responsible data handling and respectful treatment of the information used. The analysis examined what people posted on Facebook instead of identifying who made the posts. All information was presented while respecting the human dignity and agency of feminists on social media because proper care was given to prevent users' statements from being misrepresented or misunderstood. The research design needed official approval from an institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee to ensure ethical compliance throughout the research design and participant rights protection.<br />4.4 Significance of the Research Project<br />The study offered various significant findings. For instance, the study enriched the existing literature on digital feminism and digital media by providing an analysis of the impact of social media on the communication and organizing of the Feminist movement. From the analysis of the Feminist hashtags, it was established how the citizens related in different patterns of opposition and support within the virtual feminist communities. The findings will show how women and their fellow feminists advocate over social media to challenge societies&rsquo; existing hurdles that limit gender equity. Moreover, the study will be able to better understand the various types of digital platforms as tools for change for the society especially for marginalized groups to have their voices out. <br />4.5 Potential Issues and Limitations<br />The study encountered various limitations during its implementation. For instance, limitation was experienced in the analysis of the material since the users locked their accounts&rsquo; privacy to limit their availability to researchers. The two sources of information proved tricky to validate for reliability and currency because some information within the published materials was possibly no longer quite representative of modern feminism. To ensure the credibility of the study, the researcher corroborated the findings with other information sourced from other hashtags in line with prior studies (Li et al., 2021). Due to this, the study employed a systematic approach to identify pin-point features of the data's pin-point features and provide arbitrate balance in its analytical focus.<br />4.6 Conclusion<br />In conclusion, the study focused on using feminist hashtags on Twitter and Instagram through discourse analysis to identify how these hashtags allowed for feminist discourse alongside activism. The research foundation and standards of data collection and assessment methods were unique in identifying the use of social media to promote feminist causes. Potential challenges in the study were addressed by adopting methodological rigor and reflexivity, enforced and proper adherence to ethical practices of data usage. &emsp;<br />5. Analysis and Discussion<br />5.1 Analysis <br />This analysis is based on some of the Twitter hashtags, which are based on feminism and the arguments of feminist theory. These hashtags were obtained from Twitter (X), and that is only the hashtag that promotes feminism and the feminist movement. During 2016 the #HeForShe hashtag from UN Women popularized as a worldwide solidarity campaign that pursued gender equality. Through the leadership of UN Women Global Goodwill Ambassador Emma Watson, the #HeForShe campaign motivated men and boys to work with women in stopping gender discrimination because equality impacts everyone in both economic and political spheres and social areas. This initiative worked to include males and boys into a fight historical feminists had considered specifically for women. The hashtag is presented below:<br /> <br />Watson delivered an impassioned speech during the launch event at the United Nations Headquarters in New York as she stressed why male support is essential to advance women's rights. Her United Nations address became an instant hit online with more than 11 million viewers and simultaneously produced 1.1 million #HeForShe tweets from over 750,000 users in the following two weeks. Twitter designated the launch as a defining 2014 moment that it honored through a prominent display of the hashtag both inside its headquarters. <br />The newly launched #HeForShe movement surpassed its target of securing the first 100,000 male supporters in less than three days. The campaign gained recognition from multiple high-profile figures such as U.S. former President Barack Obama and actor Matt Damon as well as singer Harry Styles and UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres during its widespread growth. <br />The #HeForShe IMPACT 10x10x10 initiative launched in 2015 to generate additional momentum for gender equality programs and women's empowerment progress. Through this initiative leaders from worldwide positions such as heads of state and university presidents and corporate executives joined as role models who promoted gender equality within their leadership domains. <br />#HeForShe also gained support from educational organizations around the globe to cover more colleges and universities. The events organised by the National Autonomous University of Mexico included marches which advocated the campaign by calling for an equal overlap between male and female reproductive duties and sharing of discrimination and finding ways of solving them. <br />The campaign was not very effective and received a lot of criticism due to its methods of speaking together with lack of widespread popularity. Another critique from the other activists was concerned with the approach that referred to a focus on women only as a way of blocking male bias but in equal measure equally held on to the discrimination that should be done away with in the first place. Some common criticism was directed at the HeForShe branding since it did not capture non-binary gender identities and the transgender along with the genderqueer. However, some critics regard these as concerns viewing the presentation of women as helpless, relying on the assistance of men would reinstate the status of men as the main performers in the campaign thus promoting gender prejudice. <br />While several critics noted problems they found with the #HeForShe hashtag the campaign indeed mobilized both men and boys for gender equality conversation that challenged patriarchy and supported women. The high levels of approval and discussion on this social media campaign show social media as powerful means to engage various groups in support of justice issues.<br />#MeToo Movement<br />The revelations on cases of sexual harassment involving the movie producer Harvey Weinstein facilitated for the emergence of the #MeToo movement in the country during October 2017. The term &ldquo;Me Too&rdquo; was created by activist Tarana Burke back in 2006 for empowering women who were sexually harassed or assaulted but gained more light from social media for supporting the survivors. Actress Alyssa Milano tweeted a tweet where she wrote &lsquo;Me Too&rsquo; where many victims retweeted her and this created an endless stream of complaints from different sectors. <br />It brought about significant alterations as it led to the resignation of keen athletes as well as officials due to misconduct. Discussions also commenced on business cultures and corporate policies, and they talked about the shifts in the underlying system organizations need in order to shield those who report harassment. The second hashtag is #MeToo, which has been on Twitter since 2017 which is presented below.<br /> <br /> The above hashtag is a feminist hashtag which was used to share information on the sexual harassment that women go through from their male counterparts. The hashtag was also used to criticize people involved in sexual harassment sexually, that is, the male counterparts both at work, at home, etc. The #MeToo hashtag also received many reactions online, with women making contributions through posts worldwide (Mueller et al. 2021). Many women raised concerns online through the hashtag about the ongoing sexual harassment and implicitly expressed anti-feminist views. However, the hashtag still did not ensure physical changes as the men could still be involved in such acts and in some countries like Europe, those cases still increased in the preceding years. <br />The third hashtag is #WomenMarch, which started in 2024 and is presented below. <br /> <br />This is a feminist hashtag for women demanding equality with their male counterparts. It also advocates for the narrative that women can do what men can. The hashtag included pictures like the one below, which says, &ldquo;Anything you can do, I can do bleeding.&rdquo; This meant that men could do anything women could do as well, and thus, women should not be looked up to by men.<br />There are also Instagram hashtags about feminists that have been trending, such as #yesallmen, presented below. <br /> <br />This hashtag was trending in the year 2021 and was based on women raising their voices against men for assaulting and harassing women. The hashtag above, #yesallmen, is a hashtag above the harassment of women by men. For example, the post above is about the harassment of a woman in Lahore, whereby she was stripped naked by hundreds of men at once and thus criticized such an act against the women (Flecha, 2021). The hashtag trended widely in 2021 because it encouraged women to stand up, raise their voices, and demand respect from men. <br />Another hashtag from Instagram used in the research study is #womenrightsmatter, which is from 2021. This hashtag advocates for the respect of women for sexual harassment by men. This hashtag is also presented below.<br /> <br />The hashtag was strongly focused on mobilizing women to raise their voices about their rights through social media, mainly in 2021. This is more so with the argument that 97% of women have been sexually harassed by men, as showcased in the post above, and thus the demand for respect for women from men. Legally, the movement has initiated the enactment of laws that aim to protect people against sexual assault and harassment. The Speak Out Act was signed into law in December 2022 in the United States, which limits the enforceability of non-disclosure agreements when faced with sexual assault and harassment (Hersch, 2024). The law empowers survivors to speak out without fear of legal repercussions.<br />5.2 Discussion<br />Social media platforms support the dynamism of feminism through discussions based on #HeForShe, #MeToo, #WomensMarch, #YesAllMen, and #WomenRightsMatter. The hashtag movement #MeToo, along with its allied movements #TimesUp and others, employs Twitter and Instagram to spread feminist understandings while bringing worldwide solidarity and challenging gender-based power structures. Social media platforms are an effective tool for developing multi-layered knowledge about the relationship between new media forms and the enhancement of women's rights movements.<br />The HeForShe organizational movement beginning in 2014 under UN Women seeks male and boy participation by encouraging active involvement. UN Women Global Goodwill Ambassador Emma Watson led the campaign which described how these changes would serve both genders in the modern-day social environment. Uniting with UN made Watson the center of attention since her appearance triggered over 1.1 million #HeForShe tweets across two weeks together with more than 750 000 users who discussed the concern and its resolution through celebrity tweets that intensified the discussion. The findings connect with Li et al. (2021) as they stressed how Twitter provides expedient information sharing features that enable quick social movement engagement. The campaign faced criticism because its masculine depiction of body standards failed to include non-binary and trans individuals. The potential biases during Instagram campaign development becomes noticeable based on Boling&rsquo;s (2020) research on the platform&rsquo;s campaign construction process.<br />&ldquo;Me Too&rdquo; began as a trending in 2017 after actress Alyssa Milano reposted the hashtag on Twitter, although it was first initiated by Tarana Burke in 2006 as a means through which victims, survivors could share their stories. Penetration into sexual misconduct in the different industries prompted discussions that led to the expansion of the #MeToo movements that instigated significant change in society. The power of #MeToo movement was realized when it took Weinstein and Bill Cosby to courts to voice their claims Speaking of the notion of lawyers on the #MeToo movement, Storer and Rodriguez acknowledged that the #MeToo movement exposed Weinstein (2020). Organizations increased enforcement of the policy in the workplace following subsequent protests in Google and McDonald&rsquo;s that led to their actions (Jou&euml;t, 2018).<br />The movement has two more ongoing challenges, namely preserving its momentum and countering cyberbullying. Guilty Black Men shut down the #WhyIStayed campaign that highlighted the experiences and suffering of women in domestic violence until it met trolls who harassed and vilified survivors (Clark, 2016). The New York Times states that female journalists who covered #MeToo cases including Ronan Farrow&rsquo;s investigators received cyber harassment to ensure the reporters were quiet (Weber et al., 2020). Systemic issues that are inherited in digital activism cause movements such as #SayHerName to struggle to get attention even though it is about black women being killed (Caldeira, 2023). Some historical strides by the feminist movements for women are negated by barriers that they face till today.<br />The #WomensMarch hashtag was initiated in 2017 to express protests in support of women and issues of social justice. The movement showed that social networks are feasible of managing large meetings, and maintaining togetherness within various population. Analyzing Portuguese Instagram feminist hashtags Caldeira (2023) has discovered that such tags cause multiple manifestations of feminist views which imply various movements including #WomensMarch. Based on his research, Keller (2019) states that platform-specific feminist vernaculars as one of the issues that pose difficulties toward maintaining the unification of the feminist perspective.<br />The social media campaign #YesAllMen explained the concerns of sexual harassment and the other objective of #WomenRightsMatter was to present the rights of women. The organized efforts help women to come out with their past experiences and look for system change at the same time. These examinations show the potential of leveraging hashtags in pro-feminine Twitter adverts through the work of Rodrigues (2016) showcasing how women are empowered through gendered hashtags that challenge the traditional norms. The following campaigns denote different levels of efficiency when it comes to actual change which underlines the importance of sustained online and offline campaigns.<br />Social media integration has therefore become a revolution in the current feminist movements because it has affected both their structures as well as their possibilities of sharing content. Hence, there emerged interrupted opportunities on Twitter and Instagram; struggles in inclusion and maintenance of engagement; and problems of online hostility as the challenges of the platform. In academia, more effort needs to be done to develop strategies that close gaps because such digital, intersectional, efficient, and effective movements are necessary to achieve the goals of the said movements.<br />&emsp;<br />6. Conclusion, Limitations and Recommendations<br />Social media platforms use feminist hashtags such as #HeForShe, #MeToo, #WomensMarch, #YesAllMen, and #WomenRightsMatter to boost feminist discussion while organizing activist movements. The research by Li et al. (2021) confirms that Twitter operates as a powerful social movement platform that provides quick sharing and involvement options. The #NiUnaMenos movement in Argentina directed its hashtag for organizing a massive June 3, 2015 demonstration that brought 200,000 people to Buenos Aires to protest femicide alongside other digital platform benefits. The study reveals obstacles to maintaining continuous engagement and combats against cyber-harassment while demonstrating connections to Clark's (2016) evaluation of the #WhyIStayed campaign. Assessments about inclusivity within activist events correspond with Boling's (2020) evaluation of Instagram feminist campaigns since specific representation choices might unintentionally uphold current social prejudices. Research has shown that digital feminist activism presents broad public access and the necessity of investigating inclusive representation and sustainable outcomes during this digital age.<br />6.1 Conclusion<br />Social media tools have changed how feminist activists get out their message because they bring about a fast speed in connecting people worldwide through message dissemination. Thus, examples of such hashtags are #HeForShe, #MeToo, #WomensMarch, and #YesAllMen #WomenRightsMatter, which signify different steps of the feminist movement. The chances to communicate with the audience have never been so great during the feminism activism because through the digital platforms, they are able to amplify the messages of the activists to make them louder, to reach a global population of the audience. The increased coverage of Hollywood scandals through the #MeToo movement made people understand that sexual harassment is rampant and led to several changes in the society as well as policy changes. The #WomensMarch continued being successful due to how digital co-ordination was employed to ensure large assemblies that seek to protect women&rsquo;s rights and advocate for social justice. Contemporary experience also shows that social media acts as a change-driven mechanism which affirms other scholarly databases that digital environment facilitates call for support and group action.<br />It is essential to draw attention to several substantial issues that are linked to the process of digitalization of feminist activism. The main problem of exclusivity concerns the functioning of various online movements. Critics argue that #HeForShe campaign is actually gender binary and male dominated. The study also supports understanding on how movements are framed into continuing previous discrimination ascriptions that marginalize certain social groups. Sustaining effort is further rated as a significant challenge by online activists. While using hashtags there is a growth in attention very quickly, so, its value is less for keeping people engaged unless the organizations consistently invest time and efforts to create particular strategies. While initial involvement increases over time, it is often accompanied by a decline, which means that constant strategies that would engage the participants must be made in order to transform online activism into offline advocacy efforts. Hateful work is facilitated by the digital environment to act on radicals through cyberbullying, doxxing campaigns that result in elimination of the participants, and limit voice propagation. Some of the problems that hinder the achievement of the greatest impact are those that feminist activism requires to solve to ensure social media achieves its maximum potential.<br />Changing society for the better through such appeals entails tangible changes requiring the degree of effectiveness that varies. The process of translating the raising of awareness supported by the use of digital technologies into tangible changes in the policy and societal level at large requires the engagement of organizations that operate in both virtual and physical space. From the analysis of Feminist Advertising on Twitter it is evident that change needs web participation and this has to relate to offline activism. This smooth transition makes the online momentum translate to actual reforms due to the use of both physical and online participation. People are still disadvantaged of social media networks hence it is not possible to close the digital divide. The presence of the gaps between different communities means that marginalized members are misrepresented and the online promotion of the feminist movement will be less effective. A satisfactory level of analysis entails reviewing the performances of these platforms besides their technical issues in order to design real solutions.<br />It has now become clear that social media has a lasting influence over feminism activism because it has excellent opportunities compared to the issues it contains. However, with the advancement in technology, specifically the digital revolution, all these forms of feminists could join forces with other people globally and for diverse perspectives to have a louder voice. However, inclusivity, sustainability, online harassment, and the digital divide present substantial obstacles. Therefore, based on these challenges, the future feminist movements in the digital world should develop ways of handling the challenges facing them today to ensure they achieve the intended goals and objectives. That is why it is possible to sustain the key intent of feminism by learning the current trends in digital technologies and adapting to these changes mentally.<br />6.2 Limitations<br />Taking social media platforms as a platform for activism poses some challenges that hinder the performance of the movement. Introducing the several different acts of online harassment is crucial as a limitation for activists working in the feminist activism sphere. Cyberbullying and doxxing attacks, as well as other types of threats, compel multiple individuals to cease their activism efforts and erase themselves. It is imperative to take the digital divide issue seriously because social networking sites are inaccessible. These inequalities mean that minority groups are less likely to be represented in the possibilities of and the extent of the feminism that is being promoted through electronic media. Thus, digital campaigns may differ in effectiveness when bringing tangible changes at different stages. To enhance the change from only raising awareness through the establishment, realization, and objectives dissemination online, the physical world must connect to the virtual world that has embraced digital activism. Such problems require an elaborate approach that compares the opportunities and challenges arising from digital platforms.<br />6.3 Recommendations<br />Several suggestions could be implemented to enhance the impact of feminist campaigning on social media. It is crucial to note that digital movements always need to enroll all the members to capture the goals they have set out to accomplish. Campaign creators require developing initiatives that present different gender identities while avoiding the reinforcement of prejudice existing at present. Generous outcomes from social media activism demand ongoing interpersonal connections and tactical execution. Engaging the participant retention systems and such approaches to transform virtual activism into physical actions will help build systematic reform. To fully address the problem of online harassment, the platforms must have sufficient reporting mechanisms, efficient content moderation, and efficient support networks to be created for activist protection. The achievement of real progress means successful attempts at linking cyber activism to ground activism. These recommendations show how feminist activism can harness social media to be a very powerful and transformative communication technology.</p>",

We are also starting to see major online personalities with massive influence over us switching up what they show off. Now we see the rise of influencers who show off a health fuelled lifestyle, a new exclusive lifestyle that most of us cannot achieve. At the centre of this shift is Nara Smith who portrays a heightened ideal for living in the name of tradwife culture, where there is a great fascination surrounding her as she cooks all her foods from scratch emphasising the trending idea that health is wealth. In this dissertation I will be analysing how Nara smith creates a false perception of reality through creating an active simulacra of life, corresponding to all Baudrillard's 4 successive phases,leading to a hyperreality and the beginning of a simulation-also touching on analysing Nara&rsquo;s promise to happiness. Whilst also analysing how she creates a false perception of reality through her commentary on women through her nostalgic tradwife persona fuelled my post feminism. This dissertation will also contradict Lyotard&rsquo;s argument that there are no grand narratives in postmodernism. I will be drawing on the research designs of discourse analysis, visual discourse analysis and semiotic analysis. This dissertation deconstructs the language symbols and imagery used in Nara Smith&rsquo;s Tik Tok content to uncover levels of unattainability and the ideological work it performs. I will integrate all these strategies to justify how Nara creates a false perception of reality,Inviting viewers into a reality that is not attainable.</p>\n<p>5 LITERATURE REVIEW <br />5.1 Postmodernism<br />Within the literature of Baudrillard (1981) he discusses an overarching concept that we are now living in a &ldquo;hyperreal&rdquo; simulation constructed by mass media, advertising, technology, cinema, television and more. Moreover, Baudrillard focuses on the inescapable disorientation of society this causes; where I can apply this to the unattainability and hyper feminine Nara Smith causes through her ideal for living brand of content through her consistently making colloquial foods from scratch whilst dressed perfectly.This similarly relates to Baudrillard&rsquo;s concept of heightened &ldquo;simulation&rdquo; Baudrillard (1981,pg 6),which is a heightened version of reality that works to distract society from subtle simulation in the world. The idea of a heighted version of reality (heightened simulation) runs through Nara Smith's Tik Tok as she questions levels of unattainability through her portrayal of a clean aesthetic-where every aspect of her video radiates perfection.Significantly Baudrillard describes the phases through which an image actively turns into a &ldquo;pure simulacra&rdquo; 1.) &ldquo;Reflection of profound reality&rdquo; 2.) &ldquo; it masks and denatures profound reality&rdquo; 3.) &ldquo; it masks the absence of a profound reality&rdquo; 4.) &ldquo; it has no relation to any reality whatsoever&rdquo; eventually turning into a &ldquo;pure simulacrum&rdquo; without an &ldquo;original&rdquo; anymore (Baudrillard, 1981,pg 6). These successive phases are a paramount structure as Nara Smith&rsquo;s content conforms to all 4 stages through the artificial relatability of her voice overs, her food content and the clean aesthetic she portrays. Nara Smith's idea for living content conforms to her true nature as a simulacrum where she can be seen to create a false perception of reality through this. Baudrillard continues to build on the concept of &ldquo;hyperreal\", he defines this as hyperreality a state that follows after a simulacrum where people &ldquo;lose the ability to distinguish between reality and fantasy. He dives further by referencing Baudrillard(1995) where he argued that the gulf war that happened in the 1990&rsquo;s was hyperreal and that its media portrayal was detached from its actual reality,it became a media spectacle (Baudrillard,1991).We can understand this spectacle to also be like desire where baudrillard calls puts it as a &ldquo;charm of abstraction&rdquo; Baudrillard (1981,pg 2) at which society consumes from the simulacrum creating a hypereal environment. This relates to how Nara Smith created an environment based on a &ldquo;charm of abstraction&rdquo; through portraying a clean aesthetic and using a voyeuristic lens within her videos. This also relates closely to how Nara Smith not only creates but maintains a hyperreality through the &ldquo;illusion of actuality&rdquo; but through a promise of happiness and identity, of her content. As well as closely highlighting simulacrum and hyperreality Baudrillard also discusses simulation where he concluded that in the postmodern world that we live in we are now living in a simulation especially constructed by media (Baudrillard, 1981). Baudrillard then goes on to describe an empire which devised a map that was so precise in detail that it eventually became mistaken for the actual geography that it was only meant to represent.Essentially the map became the empire (Baudrillard, 1981,pg 1), calling this an &ldquo;allegory of simulation&rdquo;, this &ldquo;fable&rdquo; conveys his argument that today simulations have grown to the point where they now compose our understanding of reality and have &ldquo;replaced&rdquo; reality. Through Nara smith creating a simulacra of life we can slowly observe her agenda to &ldquo;substitute&rdquo; reality with her own ideal for living, her simulacra of life and specifically through the recasting of identity.</p>\n<p>In the literature of Lyotard (1979) ,Lyotard discusses the concept of postmodern society being the end of &ldquo;grand narratives&rdquo; or &ldquo;metanarratives&rdquo; and how this causes a &ldquo;problem of justice&rdquo; with the way the flow of information is controlled (Benjamin,1992). Introducing postmodernism, Lyotard describes it as an &ldquo;incredulity towards metanarratives&rdquo; where metanarratives are overarching explanations that give a bigger picture and understanding the goals of the human race also known as the &ldquo; universal truth&rdquo; (Lyotard ,1979).However Nara Smith contradicts postmodernism &ldquo;incredulity towards metanarratives&rdquo; as she creates a postmodern simulacra of life based on her Ideal for living, fueled by her tradwife persona,to ultimately spread a grand narrative of patriarchal ideologies, mormonism and alt right stance and her commentary on women through this. This can be interpreted to be the bigger picture of her content. Similarly to postmodernist thinkers like Foucault (2003), Lyotard viewed the decline of metanarratives as a positive development,both argued that grand narratives dismiss social disorientation and disorder,dismissing justice as a result- this is similar to the effects of postmodernism from Bauldrillard (1981).Lyotard also believed that postmodernism was the end of modernity, &ldquo;postmodernism thus understood is not modernism at its end but the nascent state &hellip;this state is constant&rdquo; (Lyotard, 1979) .Within Lyotard&rsquo;s views in the literature, it holds strength as it demonstrates how postmodernism is not only a result but a cause of further change in modern society. Within the weaknesses of Lyotard&rsquo;s work he can be seen in contrast to feminist theories as he ignores feminist deconstructions. However in strength of Lyotard&rsquo;s reflections on truth and justification, it indicates critical problems for the legitimation of feminist politics.Furthermore on the contradictory of grand narratives in postmodernism Baudrillard (1981) states that: &ldquo;The simulacrum is never what hides the truth&hellip;the simulacrum is the truth- Ecclesiastes &rdquo; (Baudrillard, 1981,pg1).This circulates within my case of Nara Smith as she uses her curated content to pedestal social commentary on womanhood to which has ideological truths sitting comfortably within patriarchal values, Mormonism and an alt right stance. Within the simulation she has strategically curated.there is truth in simulacra all along proven by Nara Smith spreading the narrative of Mormonism,patriarchy and Alt right through a perfect simulacra of life based on her persona of a tradwife.</p>\n<p>5.2 Gender studies,Postfeminism and Tradwifes</p>\n<p>Betty Friedan discusses her study on how the &ldquo;cultural definition of femininity&rdquo;(Carter et al., 2015,pg24) in the USA shifted between the 1940s to 50s, where she looks into the image women would conform to, which she calls this &ldquo;feminine mystique&rdquo; (Friedan,1963,pg 9) . This concept can be explored through Nara Smith&rsquo;s commentary on women, especially through her portrayal as the &ldquo;happy housewife heroine&rdquo; (Carter et al., 2015,pg24) which Friedan analyses within the USA as well as &ldquo;every corner of culture&rdquo; (Friedan,1963,pg 53). The &ldquo;happy housewife heroine&rdquo; integrated with post feminism has become what is known as Tradwife culture, a culture and persona Nara Smith is a part of and creates simulacra of life to boast this whilst using it to spread grand narratives of patriarchy.</p>\n<p>Butler (2013) discusses the beginning of post feminism spawning of feminism being &ldquo;dead&rdquo; (Butler 2013,p35) and that it should be narratively seen as a celebration to make way for post feminism. As with traditional feminism of the 1st and 2nd wave, there was a problem of integrating sexuality into feminism let alone the system with the idea that many women were not exactly catered for within the 1st,2nd and even third wave of feminism. A common issue where many women with individual expressions of femininity were not catered for within traditional feminism which is a gap that post feminism fixed. Another idea that spawned post feminism was that, in first and second wave feminism, there was too much of a victim mentality, portraying &ldquo;women as victims&rdquo; Butler (2013) instead of pedestaling them. This is an aspect Third wave feminism argued that put it into a symbolic framework of &ldquo;protection vs liberation&rdquo; Butler (2013 p5). This is a framework that transcended into post feminism with a focus of &ldquo;liberation&rdquo; as well as protection. Through the post feminism focus of liberation we can start to see Nara Smith align with post feminism through the liberation of free expression as a woman. Nara conforms to the liberation of free expression as a woman through her spreading a we can do it/united mentality towards viewers to strive to reach her ideal for living, where post feminism has aided her to do this and promise a happiness. Post feminism, surfaces as a more attractive alternative to previous gender politics where Butler (2013,p40) discusses that post feminism emphasises on &ldquo;individualism,choice and empowerment&rdquo; (Butler,pg 43). The value of empowerment is certainly prominent through Nara&rsquo;s we can do it/united mentality towards audiences and as well as postfeminism empowering her to create this message through her ideal for living she also spreads this value to create a promise of happiness. Significantly the postfeminism value of individualism and choice ties deeply with Nara&rsquo;s tradwife persona, where being a tradwife would typically be looked at as deriving away from feminism however tradwives pedestals postfeminism more than traditional feminism - as through individualism it expresses the unique ways in which women can conform to femininity,where Nara Smith has chosen to do that through being a tradwife. Through the works of postfeminist theorist Angela McRobbie McRobbie(2004, p255) she also concludes that postfeminism draws on the vocabulary of individual choice and empowerment but McRobbie (2004, p255) also discusses post feminism as being 3 definitions: linear,backlash and sex positive. In terms of backlash this refers to postfeminism pedestalling freedom for individualism which means freedom for everything validating Nara&rsquo;s tradwife persona causing backlash. Post feminism is a very neoliberal space as neoliberalism plays a significant part in postfeminism through the value of &ldquo;individualism&rdquo;. Neoliberalism commodifies individualism and champions bringing it to the market (Harvey, 2005) , further validating Nara creating a simulacra of life in the name of tradwife culture. Neoliberalism pedestals consumer culture,essentially through the &ldquo;right to rediscover what one is and all that one can be&rdquo; (Butler, 2013,pg40). Nara uses this ethos to shape a social media identity of people that aspire and subscribe to her ideal for living,framing this as the ultimate identity and performing a &ldquo;recasting of identity&rdquo; via her Tik Tok (McGuigan, 2014).Through the redefining of feminism to post feminism we can see the emergence and increasingly prominent counter-cultural of the tradwife (Bower, 2024,pg 1). Tradwives and tradwife culture are relatively new, given that the tradwife label was only applied from 2013 onwards (Tebaldi, 2021).Tradwife is shorthand for 'traditional wife' (Llanera, 2022, p. 514), a portmanteau of the two words (Sykes &amp; Hopner, 2024).</p>\n<p>Where love (2020,pg2) describes them as a group of white nationalist \"mommy vloggers\" who promote the virtues of staying at home.Which can be associated with Nara&rsquo;s consistent environment of the kitchen which is a principle in tradwife discourse. The &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; in tradwives corresponds to the aspect where their role ,often marked by their submission to their husbands (Llaners,2022), capitalises on creating social media content that reinforces patriarchal ideas (Sykes &amp; Hopner, 2024). Tradwives are also positioned as &ldquo;natural allies of the Alt right&rdquo; (Bower, 2024,pg 2) through their conservative nature and tradwives are also religious with values of Family aligning with anti abortion. These are all ideologies and narratives that Nara alludes through her commentary on women through being a &ldquo;nostalgic tradwife&rdquo; (Bower, 2024,pg 4). significantly talks about the different types of tradwives that exist within creating hyper femininity she states the &ldquo;nostalgic tradwife &ldquo; ,&rdquo;the former feminist&rdquo; and &ldquo;the southern belle&rdquo; , where through Naras portraying modesty through a clean aesthetic and traditional female roles she resonates a lot with the &ldquo;nostalgic tradwife&rdquo; (Bower, 2024,pg5). Bower (2024)also discusses the Hyper Feminine aesthetic created by tradwives which refers to the exaggerated or excessively feminine behaviours and roles (Bower, 2024,pg 4).</p>\n<p>6 RESEARCH QUESTIONS, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES <br />Research question:How does Nara Smith create a false perception of reality through her Tik Tok content?</p>\n<p>Aim: I want to prove how Nara&rsquo;s Tik Tok account creates a false perception of reality through questioning levels of unattainability and conveying a hyper feminine commentary of women.</p>\n<p>Objectives:</p>\n<p>I want to explore how Nara Smith creates a perfect simulacra of life based on her unattainable ideal for living. Within this objective I will analyse how Naras Tik Tok corresponds to the 4 successive phases in becoming a pure simulacra with no relation to reality.significantly looking at how her content is put together to achieve this simulacra of life through artificial relatability,food and the clean aesthetic Nara portrays.<br /> <br />I will aim to analyse and conclude how Nara creates a state of hyperreality towards viewers through the idea of desire and shaping a social media identity of aspires. Additionally to hyperreality I aim to justify how Nara is beginning to create an ultimate simulation.</p>\n<p>I aim to analyse how Nara creates a false promise of happiness towards her viewers by having a we can do it/united mentality.</p>\n<p>I aim to analyse Nara Smith's commentary on women through being a nostalgic tradwife and how she perpetuates a hyper feminine stance on womanhood through overarching ideologies. <br /> <br />I aim to justify how Nara smith contradicts postmodernism through her Tik Tok videos embedding grand narratives.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>7 RESEARCH METHODS/ RESEARCH DESIGN <br />I have chosen to analyse Nara Smith&rsquo;s Tik Tok because she is a clear construction of a simulacra through her hyperreal domestic aesthetic. In addition through her tradwife persona she adds further depth to my analysis.</p>\n<p>I looked the vast majority of videos and sampled 7 all within 2024, which fitted within my research aims and objectives.</p>\n<p>Within my research design I created sections and conducted discourse analysis,visual discourse analysis and semiotic analysis through sections in order to collect data corresponding to my aims.</p>\n<p>Within section 1 I conducted research on Nara&rsquo;s Tik Tok through how she creates an ideal for living and in section 2 I conducted research based on her comentarty for womanhood. Through using discourses analysis,visual discourse analysis and semiotic analysis, they all had their own part to play in each section</p>\n<p>7.1 Discourse analysis<br />Discourse analysis focuses on the study of the use of language as communication and the meaning behind the use of language,within this analysis context is key (Rose, 2012). A strength in discourse analysis is that it allows us to analyse the influence language has towards its audience and the beliefs about the way the world is-relating back to why context/ideology is key in discourse analysis. discourse analysis is effective within my research as language is a significant aspect of Nara Smiths content, through her Voiceover driven dialogue. I specifically listened to the language she uses in her voiceovers and how they create an ideal for living and create commentary on womanhood and a promise of happiness. I also used visual discourse analysis very similar to semiotic analysis but focuses on the social and cultural ideas towards visuals and allows us to understand the conditions or behaviours for visuals in a social institution (Rose, 2012). I also Synchronically conducted research where (Saussure, 1916) suggested we look at linguistic systems synchronically meaning that you will look at words within a context as part of a network of words. (Saussure, 1916)</p>\n<p>Specifically, within how I applied discourse analysis within my ideal for living section I looked at how Nara used artificial relatability in her voice overs in order to reel her viewers in to subscribe to her ideal for living and what meaning is she pairing with her artificial relatability. Through researching how she creates artificial relatability within her choice of words, I also looked at how her language in her voiceovers is unrealistic and unreliable further creating a false perception of reality through her ideal for living. In studying the use of language in Nara&rsquo;s voiceovers, I also listened to how she constructs a promise of happiness through studying the tone of her words and the instructional tone of her videos, where I closely looked at how the use of instructional language and tone can create meaning and ideology. In addition I listened to the language used in her voice overs which could be seen as an exaggeration, further shaping an unattainable ideal for living. significantly I conducted discourse analysis through listening to the language/words used to conform to patriarchal right wing and Mormon ideologies and how the meaning of the voice overs can be seen as a hyper feminine commentary on women-I collected this data for my section two of womanhood. In addition with section 2 of my groupings (women hood) I also looked at how the use of Nara&rsquo;s language in videos positioned the husband and how she presents him through what she says in her voice overs. Within conducting my research synchronically I looked at the voices as a network of words to gather more data on the meaning of Nara Smith&rsquo;s voice overs. I conducted this through observing how Naras choice of words in voice overs sounded familiar or colloquial, further trying to be relatable and also synchronically studying if she uses any language familiar with TikTok&lsquo;s meme culture. My synchronic research added to my discourse analysis on how Nara creates artificial relatability in her voice overs.</p>\n<p>Within conducting my research with visual disco services, I played a lot of attention to the social context of tradwives and visually observing the content of Nara Smith TikTok in relation to the tradwife discourse and observing aspects of the video that is prominent in the discourse of tradwives, specifically in light of the nostalgic tradwife persona.</p>\n<p>The specific data I chose to sample were videos that used language of high relatability and where incorporated the use of direct language in her voice overs like &ldquo;you&rdquo;.<br /> <br />7.2 Semiotic analysis <br />This is the study of signs and how they create meaning (Hall, 2007).This can be studied through symbols,systems, communication processes and more.Within the strengths of semiotic analysis, it can be applied to many mediums and works well with social media. This method is effective for my research as it focuses on sign systems and codes (Hall, 2007), giving me more analytical depth whilst allowing me to focus on interpretation and meaning- I will conduct my research by doing a visual analysis; I will be using it in hand with visual discourse analysis as it will allow me to look into Naras tradwife persona as well as her nostalgic tradwife persona in depth.Another way I conducted my research is through denotations vs concoctions(Evans &amp; Hall, 1999).With denotations I will look at the literal meaning of what is presented and with the connotations I will look at what an image or denotation evokes ideas of (Evans &amp; Hall, 1999), diving deeper into the symbolic meaning associated with the signs in her videos.</p>\n<p>Specifically I looked at signs, symbols, codes and conventions in my group 1 of how Nara conducts the perfect ideal for living. I conducted research on the denotations within the food in Nara&rsquo;s Tik Tok looking at the signs, symbols,codes and conventions of the types of foods she uses and the appliances she used, essentially looking at how the denotation of the food is constructed through signs and symbols, especially researching the denotations of her making food from scratch. I also conducted research on the denotation of the clean aesthetic Nara portrays and what it alluded to, I conducted this through looking at the denotation of her clothes, makeup and environment to draw on how she creates an ideal for living through these denotations. I also used semi analysis in my section 2 of womanhood to observe the signs, symbols, codes and conventions in how Nara conveys womanhood and motherhood, further adding to my analysis on Nara&rsquo;s commentary on women. I also did this again through the research lens of linking womanhood to ideologies of patriarchy,alt right and Mormonism, and the hyper feminine commentary of women these signs and symbols create hinting to these ideologies. I also looked at non-verbal cues like Nara&lsquo;s body language to observe how she conducts herself in the kitchen which would contribute supporting evidence to my visual discourse analysis of tradwife discourse. Through conducting my semiotic analysis I used denotations vs connotations, collecting this data in my second grouping of womanhood. observed the denotation of Nara&rsquo;s environment and voice overs and interpreted it through connotations to amplify analysis on the patriarchal right wing ideologies. Nara spreads through her tradwife persona and her commentary on women through this.</p>\n<p>In terms of my sampling for semiotic analysis, I chose videos that portrayed conventions of <br />Nara&rsquo;s tradwife persona and videos that align with the discourse of Tradwife culture and femininity through patriarchal values,right wing values and Mormonism. I also specifically chose videos that convey signs and conventions of 1950s Iconography as well as videos which commentate a family narrative where her husband or child is presented-relating to the patriarchal values she portrays.</p>\n<p>In terms of my outcomes I collected sufficient evidence to prove my objectives and significantly collected relevant data that corresponds to 4 successive phases of an image becoming a pure simulacra.</p>\n<p>7.3 Ethical considerations</p>\n<p>Within Nara Smith&rsquo;s TikTok content, although it&rsquo;s public for us to access, she does present her personal life on various social media as well, this inconsideration I have to refrain from analysing contents of her life that is not presented on TikTok. My research is very interpretive as I am relying on discourse, visual discourse and semiotic analysis which means there is potential for a subjective bias as I am interpreting meanings, signs,symbols and intentions. Because of this, I have to be transparent about my position and be very clear about how I have drawn conclusions.</p>\n<p><br />8 ANALYSIS/DISCUSSION</p>\n<p>8.1 Pure Simulacra of life</p>\n<p>I would like to interpret how Nara Smith creates a false protection of reality in light of Baudrillard&rsquo;s theory of simulacra and hyperreality where Baudrillard looks at the construction of the ideal and how distant it is from the real. He looks at this relationship through the &ldquo;four successive phases&rdquo; (Baudrillard, 1995,p. 6). At which an image turns into a &ldquo;pure simulacra&rdquo; a copy, representation or imitation without an original anymore through the loss of reality and exaggeration (Baudrillard, 1995,p. 6) . Through Nara Smith&rsquo;s curated Tik Tok videos she actively creates a simulacra of a perfect life based on an ideal for living which is unattainable, corresponding to the four successive phases. Within the first phase, there is &ldquo;a reflection of profound reality&rdquo; in Nara Smith's videos. There is a baseline understanding of reality in which she has integrated within creating her ideal for living, the denotation of her kitchen looks like a real kitchen with common appliances familiar to the eye such as a toaster,kettle and cupboards (see figure 1).<br /> <br /> <br />Figure 1-Kitchen environment</p>\n<p>This allows us to identify that she is in a kitchen setting. Through Nara incorporating everyday kitchen conventions to her main setting, she is mimicking reality and maintaining an &ldquo;illusion of actuality&rdquo; (Baudrillard,1995) which dominates our perception of her ideal for living.</p>\n<p>Through Nara Smith maintaining an illusion of actuality within her setting she sets the foundation layer for phase two where she &ldquo;masks and denatures profound reality&rdquo; (Baudrillard, 1995,p. 6) through the use of voice overs. Voice overs are a very essential part of Nara Smith&rsquo;s content where she uses voice overs to narrate and drive her videos to the end. In her October 4th,2024 video Smith(2024) states that &ldquo;after a 10 hour flight and the first thing my husband requests is a hot dog&rdquo; she then proceeds to make said hot from scratch. This denatures reality as what Nara has said is an unrealistic mode of living, typically after a &ldquo;10 hour flight&rdquo; you would be very tired let alone make food from scratch. She continues to denature reality by saying &ldquo;instead of running to the store I decided to make it myself&rdquo; by saying that she&rsquo;s differentiating herself from a typical relatable lifestyle and building an unrealistic way of thinking. This voice over alone is constructing a false perception of reality as she is shaping her viewers to subscribe and aspire to this unrealistic mode of living. She also &ldquo;masks and denatures reality&rdquo; by using artificial relatability in her voiceovers. In her July 10th,2024 video she refers to saying that she &ldquo;couldn't decide&rdquo; if she wanted something &ldquo;sweet or savoury&rdquo; (Smith,2024). This is a common and familiar thought towards the viewers making Nara seem more relatable and realistic. However, she masks reality by starting off as relatable then branches out into a lifestyle of unrelatability by stating that she can&rsquo;t decide if she wants something &ldquo;sweet or savoury&rdquo;, then proceeds to make a whole spread of food (see figure 2).<br /> <br />Figure 2</p>\n<p>This juxtaposition between being relatable and unrelatable is the very idea of &ldquo;masking&rdquo; reality to becoming a pure simulacra, where reality is processed and changed to fit a certain purpose. Nara seemed relatable and trustworthy at the start which would reel followers in, only to show them a lifestyle which is unattainable.The juxtaposition of her saying &ldquo;sweet or savoury&rdquo; then making multiple options of food can be seen as a complete exaggeration, with Nara Smith creating a heightened version of reality which is shaping a simulacra of perfect living. Still within artificial relatability, in her August 5th video,2024 Nara also corresponds to changing reality to fit a purpose where she relatably says &ldquo;you know those nights where you just want a little snack before you go to bed&rdquo; (Smith,2024) synchronically &ldquo;you know those night where&rdquo; as a network of words have valuable meaning in being a common phrase within meme culture on Tik Tok. By using these network words she is further trying to be relatable and common towards audiences. The use of the direct language &ldquo;you know&rdquo; directly creates intimacy between Nara and the viewers. Within creating this relatable common environment of intimacy she goes onto doing various denotations which are unreliable , i.e. making potato crisps from scratch. Through this we can observe a massive contrast between relatable and unreliable, where what the audience hears is relatable but what they see isn&rsquo;t. This is Nara masking the reality of unattainability with relatable voice overs and using these voice overs to fit her agenda of shaping a community that aspires to her ideal for living. Furthermore, Nara &ldquo;masks and denatures profound reality&rdquo; through her construction of food. Within her videos, food is presented with the idea that health is wealth,which is an idea that constantly echoes within her ideal for living brand of content. Her mindset of health is wealth masks and denatures reality through her choice of cooking colloquial foods from scratch. There is a significant theme in Nara Smith&rsquo;s Tik Tok of making everything from scratch, in her October 4th,2024 video, it would be more realistic to buy a bottle of ketchup but instead Nara proceeded to make it from scratch. This denatures normal modes of living because this is an unrealistic thing to constantly do. In her October 10th video she makes Capri Sun drink from scratch however Capri sun has an intention to satisfy children&rsquo;s needs quicker through its portable packaging. Nevertheless Nara goes ahead to make it from scratch and in doing this she&rsquo;s masking Capri sun's original purpose of being convenient, to her own purpose of obtaining a perfect ideal for living. In her June 8th, video she makes toothpaste paste from scratch performing a complete exaggeration of reality as toothpaste requires various chemicals to make. In the video Nara proposes a healthier way of making toothpaste reinforcing her idea that health is wealth. The denotation of cooking these colloquial foods from scratch (see figure 3) that are unachievable as in order to keep up with her idea for living constantly, it requires a level of housekeeping and organisation that not everyone can attain.</p>\n<p><br /> <br />Figure 3-husand and Nara,Holding baby,making Capri sun in southern belle dress,making hotdogs</p>\n<p>The time frame in Nara&rsquo;s videos denatures profound reality in her October 10th video Nara&rsquo;s children wanted a Capri sun and she &ldquo;told them to give me a minute&rdquo;. Not only is she denaturing reality but through the unrealistic time framing of the video we can see Nara Smith&rsquo;s ideal for living transitioning to Baudrillard&rsquo;s third phase of becoming a simulacra, where there is an &ldquo;absence of profound reality (Baudrillard, 1995,p. 6). When she says &ldquo;give me a minute&rdquo; she is suggesting that she will take a minute to make the drink from scratch when in reality it would take much longer through the preparation of everything. In doing this, she actively distraughts the reality of time and the absence of profound reality is what really stands out. In this video the absence of the reality of time is hidden by the contents of the video with her cooking,distracting voice overs and appearance. Within the same video she further causes an &ldquo;absence&rdquo; of reality through the editing of the videos, Nara saying it will take &ldquo;1 minute&rdquo; corresponds with the length of the video which is 1:06 Smith(2024). This has been executed by using short and fast cuts in editing the video which compresses the real time it took to prepare the fruits, chop them and blend. Through the compressed editing style and deception of time using voice overs, as well as creating a simulacra of life, Nara is on her way to creating a state of hyperreality as she is causing viewers to inaccurately judge the amount of time it takes to cook something. The absence of profound reality is further demonstrated through the clean aesthetic Nara portrays. Observing her appearance, her makeup and hair is perfectly done and put together to the minute detail with not a single hair out of place (see figure 1 and 3 ). Via this perfectly constructed appearance, she matches her perfect ideal for living which has unattainable modes of living in it and the same can be said for her appearance as it is unattainable to keep up with every day especially while cooking colloquial foods. As illustrated by the denotation of her appearance there is an absence of reality as the only thing realistic about her makeup and hair is the naturality it is suggested to convey. At length it is still a look that has been put together for content, creating a false perception of reality. As demonstrated by Nara portraying a clean aesthetic from her hair and makeup and clothes, she is masking herself as the embodiment of perfection which just doesn&rsquo;t exist. Bauldrilllard suggests that the absence of reality is hidden to pedestal an overarching purpose (Baudrillard, 1995) .Proving this idea, within Nara&rsquo;s clean aesthetic there is an absence of profound reality as it is not common to perfectly construct yourself like this to casually make food from scratch. Nara has hidden this reality and packaged it as this perfect clean aesthetic to fit her agenda of an ideal for living. Her perfect appearance is also reflected and preserved within her food, essentially she is a personification of her food as her food also looks perfect. This is enhanced through the use of camera angles and snots which is significant in the presentation of the food, capturing the essence of the food, specifically the end product of it (see figure 4)<br /> <br />Figure 4<br />The camera angles and clear shots create a perfect depiction of the food whilst making it look artificial at the same time. The transformation of Nara&rsquo;s ideal for living to a simulacra of life can be seen through this. In further addition, the absence of profound reality is successive through the clean aesthetic of the kitchen environment. We are still reminded of reality as proven in phase one; however it has been painted over and hidden by this spotless perfect kitchen that Nara has presented on the screen. The perfect spotless kitchen appears like a dream-like environment where essentially the kitchen appears to look like a tv set, just like everything else in her videos. This is where Nara Smith can be seen to have created a pure simulacra of life through the construction and contents of her videos coming together to look like one big tv set that has &ldquo;no relation to profound reality&rdquo; (Baudrillard, 1995,p. 6). In her videos there is a dominating denotation of a pristine,spotless kitchen environment where there is not one single fault creating a set like atmosphere (see figure 1). Within this kitchen everything is perfectly situated enhancing this set like environment but still maintaining an &ldquo;illusion of actuality&rdquo; through its &ldquo;relation to profound reality&rdquo;. However what activley turns the kitchen into an active simulacra is the heightened version of it that is created by the perfected,spotless kitchen to the point where it doesn&rsquo;t even look like reality. It looks fake and superficial like a set. Conforming to having &ldquo;no relation to reality&rdquo; anymore as a pure simulacrum. Within Baudrillard&rsquo;s definition of a simulacrum being &ldquo;copies without an original&rdquo; it's important to add &ldquo;copies without an original&rdquo; ,anymore, as it is so far driven from its original purpose or reality that it becomes this pure simulacra. Relating back to the heightened version of Nara&rsquo;s kitchen she has presented a distortion of reality as she has constructed the kitchen to look too real whilst reflecting her ideal for living to the point where there is no kitchen anymore. It doesn&rsquo;t exist in reality as what we are left with is a perfectly packaged version of a kitchen with a major absence of reality. Her maintaining the set of the kitchen and presenting it as a real kitchen is a false perception of reality. Moreover, where Nara masks and denatures reality through food and provides an absence of reality through the appearance of food, she is further adding to the set-like environment that has no relation to reality. The denotation of the food is heightened to perfection to align with Nara&lsquo;s ideal for living to the point where it appears to look like a prop which has connotations to not being real. Contributing to the tv set environment. Essentially Nara&rsquo;s Tik Tok content comes together to look like a cooking show, very utopic and not real life. The clean aesthetic of the kitchen environment is so heightened it looks like a set, the food is so heightened It looks like a prop and even Nara&rsquo;s clean aesthetic is so heightened that through perfect hair makeup and wearing no apron she looks like an actor giving us a performance. Baudrillard discusses that the simulacra is for its own benefits, we can conclude that Nara has indeed created a simulacra of life as she has constructed a utopic, fake environment through all successive phases and set like environment with the purpose/agenda of pushing a new exclusive lifestyle which is unattainable. In addition through the ideal for living Nara has driven away from the reality of real house makers echoing the aspect that simulacrums do not have an &ldquo;original&rdquo; anymore.</p>\n<p>8.2 Promise of happiness<br />What I find fascinating is that within Nara Smith&rsquo;s portrayal of her ideal for living, now a simulacra of life, she has a we can do this/united mentality. Normally on social media we would see this narrative where influencers displace themselves from their audience demonstrating that they can never reach their lifestyle but Nara is very inclusive within her simulacra of life and that it is a reality that can be achieved by all. This is done by denaturing and masking reality through artificial relatability, installing trust into viewers and also through guiding viewers to her idea of happiness conveyed by her instructional tone in videos. Her videos sound like an instruction manual on how to live her ideal life which is evident through her tutorial like voice overs and the use of command words in videos. In doing this she is alluding that this is a path that will lead you to happiness,whilst also installing trust into audiences so that they can trust her to lead them to this &ldquo;happiness&rdquo;. In essence she is promising viewers a &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; however this is just an illusion and a false promise of happiness because as proven through Nara creating a simulacra of life-it is a lifestyle that is unattainable through her portrayal of a clean aesthetic and cooking colloquial foods from scratch. In reality instead of happiness Nara is insisting on personal failure as she is dangling a lifestyle on Tik Tok that you will never reach through its unattainability and even if you do reach it, it will be very hard to maintain. Insisting on personal failure is demonstrated through the expensive appliances she uses in her videos. To make hot dogs from scratch she uses a sausage stuffer machine (see figure 5) and when she makes Capri sun she uses a juicer.<br /> <br />Figure 5<br />This reflects her idea that wealth is wealth, alluding that with her ideal for living, to have health you need to have wealth in order to successfully execute these meals and be happy. In shaping this ideology through the use of expensive appliances, she is challenging the social class of individuals who may not be able to afford her ideal for living and leaving them with a mentality of personal failure when they do not achieve it. Through Nara&lsquo;s illusion of happiness a state of hyperreality is formed as in packaging this simulacra of life as the &ldquo;promise to happiness&rdquo; (Ahmed, 2010) she is causing viewers to have a desire for a life that has a high chance of leading to personal failure through its unattainability. A false promise of happiness is what we are seeing.</p>\n<p>8.3 Hyperreality<br />Further analysing hyperreality Baudrillard argues that after an image becomes a pure simulacra it enters a state of &ldquo;hyperreal&rdquo; (also known as hyperreality). Hyperreality is when we lose the ability to &ldquo;distinguish&rdquo; between reality and fantasy (Baudrillard, 1995,p.2). Nara uses the idea of desire to drive audiences into a hyperreality through the desire for a perfect life which she illustrates in her videos but particularly through voyeurism. Nara Smith never looks at the camera (see figure 3) and in doing this she is creating a lens where the viewers are watching her life connoting to a doll house complex where viewers are peeping into this perfect ideal for living stimulating curiosity and a desire for Nara&rsquo;s ideal for living. The specific desire she creates through this voyeuristic position is the &ldquo;charm of abstraction&rdquo; (Baudrillard, 1995,p.2) which refers to the attractiveness and potential for insight to be found in focusing on the characteristics of something. Through the &ldquo;charm of abstraction&rdquo; that Nara has created through positioning us in a voyeuristic lens, we lose the ability to distinguish the unrelatability and unattainability in her videos because we are so blinded by the charm of abstraction, interpreted as desire, for this simulacra of life. This can also be interpreted as viewers placing desire over reality linking to Bauldrillard&rsquo;s hyperreal behaviour of taking your &ldquo;desires for reality&rdquo;(Baudrillard, 1995,p.22). In addition, through the voyeurism in Nara&rsquo;s Tik Tok&rsquo;s automatically putting us in a position of desire, She is creating the perfect consumer; because audiences will keep consuming her videos because of the desire for this simulacra of life and will want to align themselves with this false perception of reality- further pushing themselves down a rabbit hole of hyperreal. Nara also takes a new liberal approach in creating a hyperreality. Through voyeurism,artificial relatability and all aspects that have constructed her simulacra of life (successive phases); she is shaping/curating a social media identity of people that aspire to have her perfect ideal for living. Which is still feeding off of desire, however she&rsquo;s also selling his identity as the perfect one &ldquo;destined for some audience, some community and some collective&rdquo; to align with (Bower, 2024.pg5). With the idea of this social media identity being &ldquo;destined&rdquo; we are starting to see a &ldquo;recasting of identity&rdquo; from Nara&rsquo;s simulacra of life where she uses the neoliberal ethos of pedestaling the &ldquo;right to rediscover what one is and all one can be&rdquo; (Butler, 2013,pg 40). This ethos empowers her shaping a social media identity as she is framing audiences into believing that this is their &ldquo;true identity&rdquo; (McGuigan, 2014,pg232) and that they should rediscover it through consuming her simulacra of life she has created. further prompting consumer culture and prompting audiences to discover this &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; that they can find in this identity. The recasting of identity Nara is prompted by her ideal for living constructs a hyperreality because she has created a social media identity based on a simulacra of life which is a &ldquo;construction that can never be found in reality&rdquo;. It is a utopia (Weber &amp; Whimster, 2021)! Moreover , it is an identity feeding off of &ldquo;charm of abstraction&rdquo;(desire) not reality; and in light of her encouraging viewers to perform this identity she is advocating the hyperreal behaviour of taking your &ldquo;desires for reality&rdquo;. This proves Baudrillard&rsquo;s claim that today the simulacra principal dominates the reality principle where traditionally signs and images were to represent reality, however under the simulation principal signs and images no longer represent reality and now dominate over reality by creating their own hyperrealities (Baudrillard,1981). Nara has proven this through the signs and denotation of her videos creating a perfect, unattainable simulacra of life (through four successive phases) and then going on to create a hyperreality through the promise of happiness, charm of abstraction and social media identity. Altogether, she has created a false perception of reality,a reality that is unattainable and unachievable. In regards to hyperreality, we can interpret that Nara is moving into a simulation which is a &ldquo;copy&rdquo; or an imitation that substitutes reality Baudrillard (1981,pg 1) which is the agenda of Nara Smith creating an ideal for living. We can also interpret a simulation taking place through the &ldquo;recasting of identity&rdquo; she prompts, her promise of &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; and all through the construction of her simulacra of life. (Baudrillard, 1981).</p>\n<p>8.4 Commentary on women</p>\n<p>Nara Smith is a Tradwife, a modern day &ldquo;happy housewife heroine&rdquo; (Carter et al., 2015,pg24) ,marked by the submission to their husbands and capitalising on creating social media content that reinforce patriarchal ideas. Nara has created a simulacra of life as a tool to further push her tradwife persona created and fuelled by postfeminism. Postfeminism comes after third wave feminism and champions women to have &ldquo;individualism choice and empowerment&rdquo; (Butler, 2013) and that women should explore this. Through the allure of postfeminism it has created tradwives and validated Nara&rsquo;s existence to be able to come on TikTok and create a simulacra of life in the name of tradwife culture. Nara uplifts the postfeminist value of individualism in femininity and her right to explore that through a tradwife persona unlocking a neoliberal stance on discovering &ldquo;all that one can be&rdquo; (Butler, 2013,pg40). Neoliberalism is closely defined with postfeminism. Neoliberalism seeks to bring all human action into the domain of the market&rdquo; Harvey(2005,pg 3), essentially commodifying individualism which has helped Nara&rsquo;s perfect simulacra of life through allowing her to bring her individualism of femininity to the &ldquo;market&rdquo;- with the market being TikTok where she collects revenue through her millions of likes (see figure 4). Through Nara&rsquo;s we can do it mentality she is projecting what post feminism has enabled her to be and advertising it to viewers suggesting that like post feminism has helped her it can help you too, with her target audience being women. Nara having a united mentality and shaping a social media identity uplifts the postfeminism idea of choice and empowerment (Butler, 2013) as she is echoing her female viewer&rsquo;s freedom to choose a lifestyle that &ldquo;suits&rdquo; them just as she has done through her ideal for living and being a tradwife. Nara is also a perfect subject of postfeminism as she is a consumer driven woman, the denotation of her environment with expensive appliances and cooking ingredients, to the clothes and makeup she has on, suggests that she has had to buy many things to obtain this lifestyle,prompting consumerism to viewers. Also by creating a promise of happiness and social media identity for viewers she&rsquo;s reinforcing the &ldquo;consumption aspect of the neotribal self&rdquo; (McGuigan, 2014, pg 235).</p>\n<p>Through Nara&lsquo;s kitchen environment, domesticated activities, advocating modesty and historical ideologies we can decipher Nara as a &ldquo;nostalgic tradwife&rdquo; (Bower, 2024,pg4). Through her being a nostalgic tradwife she makes a lot of commentary on women perpetuating a hyper feminine environment and unattainability for women. Nostalgic tradwives &ldquo;advocate for modest dressing&rdquo; (Bower, 2024,p4) and while Nara&rsquo;s outfits aren&rsquo;t always modest in a sense, her clean aesthetic paired with the way she conducts herself with care in the kitchen brings together an ensemble of modesty. Via this ensemble she is reinforcing a certain manner that women should be. Modesty is a very traditional ideology of women with an association to the patriarchy, where this is also heard through Nara&rsquo;s soft and gentle voice overs which has connotations to ASMR emphasising, on the whispering aspect of her voice overs. In doing this Nara reinforces the patriarchal idea of women being submissive and silent, aligning with her advocate for modesty towards women. Moreover through her makeup and hair she portrays a hyper feminine aesthetic feeding into the &ldquo;cult of natural femininity&rdquo;, (Bower, 2024,pg5) way of being modest. Nara may wear makeup but through her minimal application and construction of it she conveys naturality. In constructing her makeup this way she is making a commentary to women that natural beauty is the ideal type of femininity and encouraging female viewers to lean into their natural selves (Zahay,2022,pg5). Here Nara creates hyper femininity based on natural beauty which is gender binary rooted in patriarchy and also may have racial classes undertones (McCann,2022) as her appearance can be seen as based upon a white centered construction of beauty which she is selling to viewers as a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; creating hyper femininity. This proves that nostalgic tradwife content is &ldquo;highly curated&rdquo; (Bower, 2024,pg5) creating a false perception of reality.</p>\n<p>Nostalgic tradwives also showcase &ldquo;historical ideas&rdquo; of the feminine self which can be seen through Nara pedestaling patriarchal values via 1950s iconography. The kitchen is a very important part of tradwife discourse, the denotation of the kitchen environment has connotations to a 1950&rsquo;s cooking show (see figure 1) and the slow Jazz music in the background pushes this connotation. This connotation reinforces patriarchal values of womanhood because traditionally 1950s cooking shows had a purpose of educating women on how to conduct themselves in the kitchen where Nara has the same agenda through her advocating for modesty in the kitchen and her instructional voice overs. In constructing this agenda she is alluding to the patriarchal construction that a woman&rsquo;s sole purpose in society is to be in the kitchen. Tradwife culture is marked by the &ldquo;submission to their husbands&rdquo; (Bower, 2024,pg 3). This is highlighted through how Nara&lsquo;s husband is presented in videos. In her June 8th video,whilst making toothpaste from scratch Lucky,Nara&rsquo;s husband, takes over and makes it. In the voice over Nara states that &ldquo;Lucky is very precise in his measurements&rdquo; offering the patriarchal idea that men are the right decision makers and natural providers of the family. In addition, the denotation of Lucky making toothpaste can be seen as more &ldquo;technical&rdquo; showcasing him in a more &ldquo;hero&rdquo; complex (Bower, 2024,pg 11) and as &ldquo;spectacle&rdquo; (Mulvey, 1989) (see figure 3). This presentation of her husband creates hyper femininity where Nara suggests that women require the support of a strong male partner. Moreover the denotation of the thumbnail (figure 3) with the Smith family all together positions the viewers to see this nuclear family set up as the &ldquo;primary happiness indicator&rdquo; (Ahmed, 2010) that they should strive for. A significant commentary a woman Nara makes through being a nostalgic child Wife is motherhood. In her July 10th video she holds a baby whilst cooking (see figure 3). This is hyper feminine as she is upkeeping impossible modes of motherhood and she is also doing this with the clean aesthetic appearance which is unrealistic-relating to hyper femininity being exaggerated or excessively feminine in behaviours or roles (Bower, 2024) . This definition of hyper femininity can be further seen through the denotation of Nara holding her child in the environment of the kitchen as she is alluding to the patriarchal notation that women are expected to look good in the bed as well as the kitchen and communicating a woman&rsquo;s defining purpose of conceiving. This is a false perception of reality as it is an outdated notation.</p>\n<p>Within trad culture tradwives are &ldquo;Christian wives&rdquo; (Deem, 2023) relating to Nara being Mormon which is known for its disempowerment of women already. That being said, Nara is a simulacra of a Mormon woman, if we look at @ballerina farm on Tik Tok (see figure 6)</p>\n<p><br />Figure 6<br />both Nara and her are woman wives however compared to her Nara is a exaggerated glamorised version of what it means to be Mormon creating a false perception of reality of Mormonism to Mormon audiences as well as non-Mormon audiences.</p>\n<p>Tradwives are &ldquo;natural allies of the alt-right&rdquo; (Llanera,2023,p163) this combined with nostalgic tradwives hankering historical femininity we can interpret Nara to be spreading an alt right narrative through her conveying connotations of a Southern Bell. A right wing,wealthy woman, this depiction of a southern bell can be drawn from her soft spoken voices and the elaborate clothes she wears accentuating her shoulders and breast (see figure 3,Capri sun). Nara also takes a right-wing stance on abortion laws through her religion of modernism and her clear portrayal of women&rsquo;s role to conceive. We can conclude that Nara would advocate against abortion. The denotation of her holding a baby symbolises the sacredness of life aligning with anti-abortion and Trumpism, where in the 2024 US elections Trump relied on Christians as supporters and &ldquo;patriots&rdquo; (Deem, 2023) in hoping to make America great again through abortion laws Nara being a nostalgic tradwife sits in many aspects of Trumpism.</p>\n<p>8.5 Grand Narratives<br />Through Nara Smith&rsquo;s Tik tok content she conforms to postmodernism and contradicts it at the same time. Nara uses the postmodern theorist Jean Baudrillard&rsquo;s concept of simulacra and simulation to create a perfect simulacra of life to a hyperreality and the beginning of a simulation. However she contradicts postmodernism through reinforcing grand narratives, contradicting Lyotard. Grand narratives are overarching stories that claim to explain things (Lyotard ,1979) and Lyotard argues that these narratives have lost their credibility and are unstable as subjects of work could have many meanings (Lyotard,1979). Lyotard describes postmodernism as an &ldquo;incredulity towards metanarratives&rdquo;(Lyotard,1979) . However Nara contradicts Lyotard by using postmodernism to create a simulacra of life to essentially spread the grand narrative of patriarchy, Mormonism and an alt-right/Trumpism stance. She embeds these narratives into her postmodern perfect simulacra of life creating a breach in lyotard's concept. She also contradicts postmodernism through Buldrillard&rsquo;s work as he states that &ldquo;we live in a world where there is more and more information and less and less meaning&rdquo; (Baudrillard,1981,pg4) drawing from this you can argue that there actually can be meaning in a simulation as proven through Nara Smith&rsquo;s Simulacra of life being made in the name of tradwife culture which perpetuates the grand narrative of patriarchy, momism and right wing/trumpism. Which is actually the truth of tradwives,the &ldquo;trad-truth&rdquo; (Deem, 2023). Through Nara Smith with unlocking the truth through her perfect simulacra of life I can draw that simulations actually have more truth than reality.</p>\n<p>Ultimately Nara smith&rsquo;s TikTok content creates a false perception of reality through corresponding to all 4 of Baudrillard&rsquo;s successive phases highlighting her content is not a reflection of everyday living but rather a heightened simulation of it based on her agenda for her perfect ideal for living which is unattainable.I have proven that she creates a false perception of reality through justifying that her promise of happiness is in fact driving viewers to personal failure whilst creating a hyperreality through the idea of desire for a life that is unattainable and through also shaping a social media identity that blurs the lines between reality and desire. Moreover Nara also creates a false perception of reality through her hyper feminine commentary on women through being a nostalgic tradwife, which aligns with 1950s patriarchal values, an alt right stance and Mormonism. Which is all outdated and doesn&rsquo;t leave space for the different identities of women.</p>\n<p><br />9 CONCLUSION<br /> <br />Through my research question being how does Nara Smith create a false perception of reality on Tik Tok? I have proven this through Nara creating a simulacra of life based on her ideal for living which in conclusion has &ldquo;no relation to reality&rdquo; which she has done through corresponding to all the four successive phases of becoming an active simulacra 1) there is a relation to profound reality 2) it masks and denatures profound reality 3) there is an absence of profound reality 4) it has no relation to reality becoming a pure simulacra. Further proving that she has created a pure simulacra of life by creating a TV set environment highlighting how she has heightened the contents of her videos to the point where they do not look like reality anymore but in Nara Smith representing this as reality she has created a false perception of reality. She has further proven a false perception of reality through the unattainability of her ideal for living which runs through all the successive phases through her clean aesthetic food and voice overs. She has also created a false perception of reality through the illusion of the promise of happiness and creating a social media identity that does not exist and lastly she has created a false perception of reality through giving out her hyper feminine commentary on women through being a nostalgic tradwife. Hyper femininity is caused through the patriarchal right/Trump state stance on women which does not sit in today's society as well as Nara being a simulacra of a Mormon woman deriving away from the real Mormon Religion.significantly Nara&rsquo;s simulacra of life contradicts postmodernism where we can conclude that there is a stable overarching truth in simulations, you just have to look closely. With everything that has been stated,I have come to this conclusion through my research of discourse,semiotic and visual discourse analysis.Within where I see this project fitting into the future, tradwives is a new phenomenon that has grown since 2020 and there&rsquo;s still a lot more room for it to grow in terms of scholarly data and other frameworks . However I see this project benefiting political and ideological implications on how social media influences could have a big impact on politics where politicians use influences that align with their ideologies to create a political simulation and hyperreality.</p>",

This dissertation aims to discuss whether the James Bond films reflect the major social and political themes of their time. In particular, the purpose of this project is to provide an insight into three main cultural themes: political messages reflected received from historical events; gender bias especially objectification of women in these films and genre and masculinity &ndash; how the action hero evolves over decades. The data for this dissertation was discussed through narrative, textual and semiotic analysis. I have focused on three Bond films, Goldfinger (1964), Goldeneye (1995) and No Time To Die (2021). The reason for focusing on these three films is because they each represent a cultural change in society which reflects the main theme I have focused on. Additionally, they represent a different decade from across the Bond franchise &ndash; 60s, 90s and 2000s. Through my research, it became apparent that each film reflected the cultural norms of their time: Goldfinger &ndash; fear of enemies linked to the Cold War and nuclear Bombs, women used as objects, men should be cold, independent, strong and always save the day. Moving through to the 90s, Goldeneye &ndash; we are no longer at war with Russia, but do we trust them, women are in powerful roles but still rely on the hero. Finally, in the 2020s when our enemies are not governments or countries but global terrorist groups. Men are no longer womenisers who take women for granted, heroes have a weakness- the families they make sacrifices for. These findings indicate that while many audiences may believe that Bond films are sexist and demonstrate the traditional action hero, where that may have started out as this in the 60s, they have evolved as cultural ideals have changed over the past 50 years. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Introduction<br />In 1962, Prime Minister Harold MacMillian dismissed his third cabinet, The Beatles released their single &lsquo;Love Me Do&rsquo;, and the first instalment of the James Bond franchise &lsquo;Dr No&rsquo; premiered in UK cinemas. Spanning over 60 years, the Bond franchise has continued to entertain audiences with action, espionage and charm. The franchise is based on Ian Fleming&rsquo;s main character, James Bond. This character is introduced as a spy during the Cold War, with his trained intelligence and special gadgets, he would fight back against international and Soviet spies. He was a passionate gambler, always with a glamorous woman on one arm, his trusty Walther PPK by his side and a vodka martini never too far away, always loyal to the British Government.</p>\n<p>The Bond franchise was a phenomenal success; The film \"Goldfinger\" (released in 1964) grossed a total of $124.9 million worldwide, with $51.1 million domestically and $73.8 million internationally, making it the fastest-grossing film of its time. However, do the exploits of a womanising alcoholic reflect the changing ideals of society? As Weiner comments, &lsquo;Bond character&rsquo;s eye-spy bravado glorifies male virility, extols casual sex, and highlights the importance of sexually conquering all women, especially those deemed as femme fatale&rsquo;. (Weiner et al., 2011) Does this reflect the radical changes which have taken place since Bond&rsquo;s first release, especially changes since the women&rsquo;s liberation movement in the 1960s, where their roles in social, cultural, political and economic life have drastically changed and progressed for the better.</p>\n<p>This dissertation will focus on the Bond franchise and how it reflects topical issues. Do these films follow stereotypes linked to women in films, masculine representation, political landscape? Do they portray groups in a positive or negative light? The concept of the films was based on the novels of Ian Fleming which were written between 1953-1966. Can films based on an action hero created in the 50s and 60s be relevant to audiences of the 90s and 2020s?</p>\n<p>I will focus on three main areas: Political messages, Women and the Action Hero genre. This research will explore this concept further by exploring narrative, textual and semiotics analysis. I will focus on three Bond films spanning six decades: Goldfinger (1964. Dir. Guy Hamilton) Goldeneye (1995. Dir. Martin Campbell) and No Time To Die (2021 Dir. Cary Joji Fukunaga). I chose these films out of the 26 Bond films released as each one represents a different decade and a shift in the social representation of the films.</p>\n<p>Goldfinger (1964) represents the style of the early Bond films and has all the hallmark ingredients: a villain who is attacking a government organisation, women represented as objects and aids to Bond&rsquo;s success, examples of the term &ndash; Bond Girl &ndash; a scantily clad beautiful women who are easily seduced by Bond. Plus, the Bond character single-handedly saving the world.</p>\n<p>Goldeneye (1994) represents a change in the Bond formula. After a steady flow of Bond releases from 1962 -1989 (17 films in 27 years) due to poor box office figures for License to Kill ($391.4 million) there had been speculation that the Bond franchise had come to the end of their success. After a six-year gap &ndash; Goldeneye was released with a promise of a more modern Bond &ndash; one who would not have a girl on one arm and vodka martini in the other. But could Bond change to fit a decade which had just had a female Prime Minister for the last eleven years?</p>\n<p>No Time To Die (2021) is the latest film in franchise currently and had to adapt the character to a spy for a technological world. There is no Cold War, we do not fight terrorists in hand-to-hand combat but instead with biochemical warfare. Can the Bond producers adapt our 1950s hero to the 2020s?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />Literature review.</p>\n<p>Political message</p>\n<p>Films can reflect and critique the political messages and global themes of their era. The James Bond films, in particular, explore issues using their spy narrative such as the Cold War and terrorism.</p>\n<p>Begg and Moran both discuss in their articles about James Bond being a hero during the Cold War. Firstly, Begg (2016, pg. 93) discusses the politics of James Bond; he highlights how the United States (with their allies) and Russia were fighting during the Cold War in the 70s and how it reflected, in the James Bond universe &lsquo;perhaps going to predict the end of the Cold War.&rsquo; This implies that the James Bond series is communicating a political message to viewers at the time, providing viewers with a hero and therefore giving them hope during this time of conflict. It provides a sense of escapism from reality while still reminding audiences of the narrative of this time.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Moran (2013, pg. 124) discusses how the writer portrays the CIA in this franchise. In the article, he highlights that the &lsquo;CIA is shown to be a force of good in a dangerous world&rsquo;. This contradicts the negative connotations that the CIA normally has in the media; that they cannot be trusted. In the franchise, the CIA is portrayed as a force of good, which manipulates the audience into thinking that the CIA is an upright organisation. Having James Bond and the CIA trust each other reflects that friendships can be forged during big conflicts and by working together, solve problems and issues.</p>\n<p>Together these two articles highlight how the James Bond franchise uses the character and other government agencies as heroes, saving the day. This affects the representation of the James Bond franchise because having the character associated with certain agencies and making them appear as &lsquo;good&rsquo; and &lsquo;trustworthy&rsquo; could mislead audiences. Watchers of the films who have a negative mindset towards government agencies, spies and particularly the CIA, could view the Bond franchise as a propaganda tool to send a political message and forget that Bond is just a fictional film character.</p>\n<p>Laucht and Gehrig have articles on how the narrative of James Bond evolved in some respects while remaining the same in others leading to cultures appearing better or worse. Laucht (2013, pg. 359) discusses the phenomenon of James Bond against the changing climate in post-Cold War Britain. The article demonstrates that &lsquo;many bond films and stories refused to adapt to the shifted political landscape of the Cold War&rsquo;. This links to how the writers create a character in James Bond who refuses to move on from the Cold War, a narrative which keeps the character stuck in the past and unable to move with the changing political landscape.</p>\n<p>In addition, Gehrig (2019, pg. 10) mentions how some narratives were changed from the source material because they were afraid of &lsquo;political controversy&rsquo;. When the novels were originally released, certain political groups were seen as enemies, so they were placed in the stories as villains. However, by the time the films were released, these people became allies of Britain. This was to ensure the films caused no offence to influence political groups.</p>\n<p>These two readings explain that story writers needed to keep the traditional British hero consistent, after all, audiences do not like their heroes to change. However, villains can reflect the political landscape of the time. This gives an understanding that everything changes around the central character and that he must remain the constant, to be &lsquo;James Bond&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>Prorokova-Conrad and Burnett talk about how James Bond was used to confuse the plot of the Cold War. This is demonstrated when Prorokova-Conrad (2022, pg. 3) writes about how the ideologies of James Bond were used for a political message during the Cold War but ended up being a &lsquo;conflict of ideologies&rsquo;. This indicates that the message they were trying to sell confused many people&rsquo;s beliefs about the Cold War. British people thought they should follow Bond&rsquo;s way of thinking as he is the hero and therefore non-Brits were the enemies.</p>\n<p>Burnett (2014, pg. 176) spins the narrative and sees Bond as &lsquo;the power of Western individuality against an enemy&rsquo;. This shows that Bond is not just a pawn for the country but a symbol for those fighting against their enemies. This point helps broaden the understanding of the James Bond character, that he is a representation of hope, standing up against the enemy. This led to the character being understood and accepted by more communities.</p>\n<p>These two readings demonstrate that when analysing the use of James Bond during the Cold War he is seen as a political message for Britain. However, he is also viewed as a symbol fighting against enemies and therefore he can belong to anyone.</p>\n<p>Cutler and Lewis write about the type of character that Bond had to become coming out of the Cold War. Firstly, Cutler (2021, pg. 1) has an understanding that, hopefully, the Cold War will finish soon, and that the Bond character will have to change. He says this by highlighting &lsquo;that Bond would need a new adversary to stay relevant&rsquo;. This means that Ian Fleming, the author, knows that to gain the right audience, he must shape James Bond differently depending on what is happening in the world around us so that audiences can relate.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Lewis (2018, pg. 4) talks on a different point on how the James Bond character changes after the Cold War. He highlights that he &lsquo;gained initial recognition for his representation of the lone British hero, who served at Her Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure&rsquo;. This indicates that Lewis thinks that the Bond character has significant qualities which will ensure that he is recognised quickly and so that audiences continue to follow him after the Cold War.</p>\n<p>These two readings tell us that Fleming constructed a flexible narrative which included changes to the Bond character after the Cold War ended. If this character was still set as he was in the novels during the Cold War, then the audience would not be able to empathise with the character and they would not be able to relate to the setting. <br /> <br />Gender</p>\n<p>The James Bond films have caused extensive debate on gender roles and how women are perceived in society.</p>\n<p>Racioppi, Tremonte and O&rsquo;Brien analyse how women are presented in the bond titles. Together, Racioppi and Tremonte (2014, pg. 21) discuss the roles of women in the opening title sequences of the James Bond films. They highlight that women&rsquo;s bodies are identified as &lsquo;sex objects, threats or victims of violence&rsquo;. Having the women present in this way at the beginning of the film sets a narrative for the rest of the film. The audience already views them as sexual objects and victims and this notion stays with the audience throughout the film.</p>\n<p>Similarly, O&rsquo;Brien (2020, pg. 103) talks about how women are not only objectified but also faceless. She highlights that the women&rsquo;s bodies are &lsquo;silhouetted, naked or semi-naked&rsquo;. The use of the word silhouetted shows that the women are not seen as people just parts to present as objects. They use their faceless bodies to make up other elements like guns and bullets. Women have no personality or individuality; they are just objects.</p>\n<p>These two readings show that women are seen as objects. They are not characters, they are not people with feelings, they are just materials to be modeled to give an overall image to please the male audience. This also sets the scene as to how women will be treated throughout the film.</p>\n<p>Bassil-Morozow and Hackett, Coghlan, Nolan discusses about how Bond girls are represented by the power of their sexuality. Bassil-Morozow (2020, pg. 94) focuses on how Soviet women are presented in bond films. These characters have the connotations of being powerful, cold and detached. She highlights that as &lsquo;strong as she is, the Soviet girl still needs to be saved by her British lover&rsquo;. This shows that even the coldest of women can be broken by Bond&rsquo;s persona and charms.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Hackett, Coghlan and Nolan (2023, pg. 5) discuss what the phase &lsquo;bond girls&rsquo; symbolises. The reading highlights that the women in Bond just have the role to &ldquo;tempts, distracts, and [or] assists&rdquo; Bond in the films. This is significant because, due to Bond girls being attracted to Bond, they have the power to lure him into these dangerous situations where there are villains and make great sacrifices when participating in the mission to try to beat the villain.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, these two readings tell us that the Bond girls are intelligent characters because they can manipulate James Bond using beauty and sex. However, due to these elements, they can become a weakness when taken advantage of by Bond.</p>\n<p>Garland and Weathers focus more on the Bond girls&rsquo; relationship with Bond. Weathers (2024, pg.2) highlights that Bond girls are &lsquo;defined by their relationship to Bond&rsquo;. This statement shows that the characters are not fully developed until they interact with James Bond. Hence why the female characters are always known as Bond girls and not by their own character name.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Garland (2009, pg. 186) talks more about how, in more recent films, the femme fatale has advanced. He highlights that &lsquo;existing elements of the bond girl are reconfigured to maintain expected elements of bond films, recreate bond characteristics and increase the complexity of bond and his relationships&rsquo;. This means that the Bond girl persona still has the components of being the sexy female character, however qualities have been added over the years to make the characters seem more vital to the narrative, supporting Bond. This takes the relationship between James Bond and the girls to a deeper level. The female character is needed to support Bond and help solve the mission, unlike in the past when she only needed saving.</p>\n<p>Leach, Funnell and Johnson all talk about how different types of women are presented in the James Bond narrative. Leach (2015, pg. 31) expresses how the shift changes from a male as the character of M, the head of MI6, to a female in the role, reflected the real-life world. He compares the new female M with Margret Thatcher by highlighting &lsquo;Thatcher&rsquo;s determination to make Britain great again, echoed the nationalist wish-fulfilment fantasy in the bond text&rsquo;. This shows that in the more modern James Bond films, writers realised that changes in their films to give women the right representation had to happen. However, due to their reputation, the new representation is manifested as an older lady who is powerful, instead of a young one that would be an attraction to Bond.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Funnell and Johnson (2020, pg. 96) discuss that women are changing in Bond films. They highlight that through their research, they understood that the &lsquo;characterisation of women has been influenced by social movements, limited attention has been added towards public preferences and expectations regarding Bond girls&rsquo;. This suggests that in many recent Bond films, the writers have taken ideas from the real world and the Bond girls have evolved from being just seen as objects to characters with a core role in the narrative.</p>\n<p>This leads to the difference between Bond girls and Judi Dench&rsquo;s appearance as M. When M is changed to a female actress, she is shown as a strong and cold woman, whereas the Bond girls are seen as a sexy piece of eye candy for Bond. M is seen as a mother figure for Bond, caring for him and protecting him. She is not a character he would have a sexual relationship with.</p>\n<p><br />Masculinity in the Action Genre</p>\n<p>The James Bond franchise is an example of the changing portrayal of masculinity in the action genre, reflecting on how social expectations around gender have evolved.</p>\n<p>Holt, Thompson and Gallagher discuss how male characters' masculinity in the action genre films are presented. Holt and Thompson (2004, pg. 428) explain that &lsquo;heroic men of action embody the rugged individualism of the rebel while maintaining their allegiance to collective interests, as required of breadwinners&rsquo;. This means that the characters have different elements as a part of their personal preface. They are seen as strong men who get the job done but there is a sense of loneliness and passion to do what it takes to save the day.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Gallager (2016, pg. 81) understands that writers are finding it harder to keep key elements that make a perfect action hero in films due to this ideal not fitting into society. He highlights this by commenting that &lsquo;films struggled to construct characters and narratives that both mirrored the era&rsquo;s shifting values and preserved time-honored ethical codes and models of interpersonal relations&rsquo;. This explains that with new challenges developing in the real world, it is hard to re-create an action hero that existed before changes in male perceptions in society were highlighted and kept the more traditional male character.</p>\n<p>These readings tell us that the action genre is constantly changing from what it was before changes in society. With this, the components that it took to make the great action man have also changed too. The traditional male action characters that the older generation grew up with, are not understood or accepted in the same way and must evolve to fit and succeed in a more modern society.</p>\n<p>Soberon and Hinton talk about how differently the action man is observed. Firstly, Soberon (2021, pg. 156) discusses how generally actors can only obtain leading roles if they are in good physical shape. He explains this by saying, &lsquo;Physical prowess is only one way for men to imbue with a sense of hegemonic masculinity&rsquo;. This means that physical appearance is a main contributor when looking for an action hero. From past findings, it is understood that these characters must be strong and attractive.</p>\n<p>However, Hinton (2025, pg. 2) looks at the newer type of action man and realises that they are portrayed as &lsquo;softer&rsquo; and an &lsquo;everyman&rsquo;. This shows that the stereotype of the strong action man is slowly disappearing. This change will help more actors obtain roles based on their acting ability and not just their physical appearance. Even though this change is seen as a positive, it limits narratives and removes the &lsquo;action&rsquo; from the action genre.</p>\n<p>These two readings discuss the different characteristics of the action hero. Normally, when the phrase action hero comes to mind, people conjure an image of strength and muscle, and this still applies in some contexts. However, many writers understand the change in society and that a man does not need to follow these connotations. A hero can use his mind and not just his muscle. However, these modern narratives can irritate the older generation who are unfamiliar with this new action hero. <br />Cohen and Wildgen speak more about how the genre of action films is manipulated to make these characters appear more dangerous and attractive. They both talk about James Bond specifically. Cohen (2016, pg. 104) understands that the image of James Bond is distorted by digital enhancement. This is examined through the &lsquo;conflicted articulations of the digitally enhanced image of Bond&rsquo;. This means that what is shown on screen is not always real life. The actor is probably already muscular and strong, but enhancements such as shaping and sweat are used to make the actor look more appealing.</p>\n<p>In addition, Wildgen (2014, pg. 438) understands how the narrative of the James Bond films mirrors the action genre. He highlights in his article by saying the &lsquo;first scene of the Bond film escalates the chase theme and embeds it into the story that occasioned it&rsquo;. This means that Bond films use pre credit sequences to set up narratives. They use an introductory scene that grips the audience when they first watch it, this scene then leads to the title sequence, which Bond films are well-known for and keeps audiences watching. These pre-credit sequences are a hook to the audience, introducing the main character in a fast-paced action sequence.</p>\n<p>These two readings tell us that the digital screen can help develop the action genre. The creators add extra elements to the films which develop the appearance of the characters and use special scenes to hook the audience and keep them watching.</p>\n<p>Kvaran and Gjelsvik discuss the effects on an action man&rsquo;s masculinity when a father figure is present or not. Kvaran (2017, pg. 223) highlights that when father figures are a part of the action-man&rsquo;s life, it can influence their behaviour. He underlines this by stating &lsquo;that masculinity, strength, and heroics exist within the male domain and encourages a hegemonic form of masculinity wherein masculinity must be proved and reinforced by other men&rsquo;. This means that masculinity must be present in an action film. This will either come from the main action character and be forced into them as no father figure is present, or if it is not a part of them, it is normally shown through a father figure. When this masculinity comes from a father figure it can make the main action character feel suffocated or act out.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Gjelsvik (2025, pg. 93) understands the effects of the masculinity of the action man character when they have the role of a father figure. He indicates that in these action films, it &lsquo;became common to talk about the collapse of traditional masculinity&rsquo;. This means that many action films began to soften up and break down characters and develop their personality and give them a broader range of feelings. This change from a hard man to a soft, emotional man takes the thrill out of action films; the main character is not just thinking of himself but others. <br />These two readings explain that depending on how and whom masculinity comes from affects the flow of the narrative. Father figures are an important element that supports certain choices which are made. There is also an understanding that this father figure&rsquo;s behaviours influence how the main character understands the world around them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br /> <br />Methodology</p>\n<p>I will be analysing these films through narrative, semiotic and textual analysis to explore representations of political messaging, gender and the changing masculinity of the Bond action hero. By selecting Goldfinger (1964), Goldeneye (1995), and No Time to Die (2021), I have chosen films which represent historical and cultural changes within the Bond franchise.</p>\n<p>Narrative analysis shows how real-life people are represented through a story. This can be understood through Bond because each film presents what was happening during that time. An article written by Martin Cortazzi(1994, pg. 157) tells us that &lsquo;narrative structures are used to interpret an ever-widening range of human experience&rsquo;. This means that the narrative is the best way to understand a story and the message that is being received.</p>\n<p>Textual analysis is the understanding of the structure of text. Knowledge of this can be shown through Bond because the text develops depending on the year of release. An article written by Laura Mulvey (2005, pg. 228) has an understanding that if you &lsquo;read the cinematic language of displacement, consciously or subliminally, textual analysis enriches and illuminates these signifying elements.&rsquo; This means that textual analysis highlights the features in a film that are present but have more of a significant meaning than is originally realised.</p>\n<p>Semiotic analysis is the study of signs and symbols. This understanding can be shown through Bond because the signs in the narrative help pass significant messages to the audience. A chapter written by Warren Buckland (2001, pg. 84) tells us that film is a coded medium like natural language and possesses a specific, autonomous, underlying system&rsquo;. This means that film is not just for entertainment but provides messages.</p>\n<p>Narrative Analysis</p>\n<p>Goldfinger was set during the 1960s and during the Cold War. The threat is a European which could be linked to communism. When audiences viewed this narrative, it encouraged them to believe that non-Americans are villains and not to be trusted. The film also plays on the audience&rsquo;s fear of nuclear bombs. This reflection is important because it shows that the narratives will relate to common fears held by the audience. Goldeneye was released in 1995; the gap between the previous Bond film and this one was longer than had occurred with previous films. The narrative explains the changes in society after the Cold War ended. Due to the villain being an ex-MI6 agent, this demonstrates to audiences that threats come from within our own organisation and not always from Russia or other countries. The film is set in Russia, so the narrative bridges the gap between the end of the Cold War and new threats to democracy. No Time To Die is currently the final instalment of the Bond franchise, being released in 2021. The Cold War has been over for 30 years, so the narrative does not have any of these elements anymore. However, due to the film being released a year after the COVID-19 pandemic, the film has slight references to this. For example, the narrative of a bioengineered virus. Viruses with weapons as a narrative amplifies the audience&rsquo;s fear. <br />The narrative of gender in Goldfinger informs the audience that gender is unbalanced. Men are respected, and women are used for sex. The narrative reflects how women are used as a disposable tool and not valued. The narrative analysis of gender in No Time To Die is different from the previous films. Female characters have more engaging roles: Moneypenny supports Bond rather than just being a secretary to M; other 00 agents are women &ndash; even his 007 replacement is a woman. M is no longer a woman, but the narrative demonstrates a male leader who supports his female agents over Bond. <br /> <br />The narrative for masculinity in Goldfinger demonstrates that Bond reflects the elements traditionally shown of an action man. Audiences were familiar with gritty heroes, while James Bond, especially in Goldfinger, narrates a different action man. He gets the job done in a neatly ironed outfit and is still able to have a relaxing time with his chosen woman and enjoy an alcoholic drink. The narrative of masculinity genre in Goldeneye is consistent to the original 1960s formula. He is still cold and dominant. However, Bond has less sexual encounters with the female characters. The females in the narrative demonstrate more resistance to Bond&rsquo;s charm, which affects Bond&rsquo;s masculinity as he is less charismatic to the women and could be seen as weaker.<br />Bond&rsquo;s masculinity in the No Time To Die narrative is completely different to the other two films that are discussed. James Bond demonstrates more emotion in this film; this change gives Bond more depth with a range of feelings and less masculinity. Therefore, the film reflects a male hero which mirrors men of the 2020s. If the film has too much connection and attention to the main character&rsquo;s feelings, the narrative can then feel too real and too honest; there is little to no escapism for the audience, and the film starts to become a genre that it was not originally intended to be.</p>\n<p>Textual Analysis</p>\n<p>The language in Goldfinger helps us understand that crime to be controlled by the powerful. This is highlighted when Auric Goldinger says, &lsquo;Man has climbed Mount Everest, gone to the bottom of the ocean. He fired rockets at the moon, split the atom, achieved miracles in every field of human endeavour&hellip;except crime.&rsquo; (Goldfinger 1964). This claim from Goldfinger tells us that even though technologies were evolving during the Cold War, there is no evidence that the war would end. This changes in Goldeneye when M demonstrates that we are no longer impressed with the Americans, when she implies that they are stupid when she states, &lsquo;Unlike the American Government, we prefer not to get our bad news from CNN&rsquo;. Textual analysis of the plot and setting shows that Bond has moved on from Russia and the Cold War to different location and threats.</p>\n<p>The language from Bond towards women is developed through textual analysis. He specifically makes lewd comments towards Pussy Galore, however Galore can only ward off his charm for so long. As he makes one of these rude remarks she responds with, &ldquo;You can turn the off the charm because I&rsquo;m immune&rdquo; (Goldfinger 1964). This is effective because it gives Galore the power to reject Bond, this also hints to the possibility that Galore was intended to be a lesbian prior to script changes. As Bond evolves over time, once we reach the 2020s with No Time to Die the dialogue is no longer filled with lurid comments made to women by Bond but demonstrates respect for the women around him.</p>\n<p>In Goldfinger, Bond shows the audience how masculine he is, but his language about his weapon can say the opposite. This is understood when he says, &ldquo;I have a slight inferiority complex&rdquo; (Goldfinger, 1984). This tells us that without his gun he loses power. The weapon is what makes him a man. <br /> <br />Semiotic Analysis</p>\n<p>Symbols in Goldfinger, of the main characters - James Bond and Goldfinger - symbolise the two countries in the Cold War: America and Russia. The characters may not originate from these countries, but they represent these nationalities fighting against each other. Semiotic analysis in No Time To Die plays on audience&rsquo;s fear of weapons we cannot control. For example, air-borne viruses and bioweapons. The helplessness of Bond when he discovers that he must sacrifice himself for the safety of his child is a symbol all the audience can relate to.</p>\n<p>Symbols that are analysed for gender include Jill Masterson being covered in gold after she sleeps with Bond leading to her betraying Goldfinger. When she is found dead, she is naked and gold. This symbolises that her existence in the film is an object to be disregarded after use. Semiotic analysis of Goldeneye focuses on the change of gender representation in society. Judi Dench arrives in the cast as M which is a change for audience as previously leaders were always male. This change is important because, during the 1990s, &lsquo;working mothers&rsquo; were more common but despite women being common place in the work force, few of them where CEOs of major companies. Men would not understand this, as they would not be familiar with taking orders from a woman, a woman who is not attracted to them.</p>\n<p>The symbols of the historic Bond are still evident in No Time To Die as audiences look for high action car chases, gadgets supplied by Q branch and fight scenes despite Bond&rsquo;s character having developed more emotional depth. <br /> </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Analysis</p>\n<p>Before the film was released, the James Bond character was introduced by British writer Ian Fleming in his thriller novel Casino Royale, which was released in 1953. The character was first seen as a spy in the Cold War, with his trained intelligence and special gadgets. He would fight against international spies, in particular Soviet spies. Bond was a passionate gambler who always had women on one arm and a vodka martini in his hand. Despite his playboy characteristics, he remains loyal to the British crown. Fleming continued to feature James Bond in another twelve books and short stories over the next nine years until 1962, when the book Dr No, written in 1958, was made into a film.</p>\n<p>As we know James Bond was originally created as a Cold War spy, we can understand the political messages that are portrayed in these films. <br />In Goldfinger, the villain plans to blow up Fort Knox, which is by a military base in Kentucky. The site is used to store the United States of America&rsquo;s gold reserves along with other valuables belonging to the government. The character of Auric Goldfinger is a dealer and international gold smuggler who plans to use money from different Mafia groups to build an atomic bomb which he will use to blow up Fort Knox and the gold reserve inside. Anyone who gets in his way, dies. Goldfinger, along with his henchmen try to kill James Bond as he attempts to foil their plans.</p>\n<p>This plot in Goldfinger is significant because of the political message it sells. From the reading by Begg, he has an understanding that what is seen on screen influences audiences&rsquo; opinions about the situation. As this is a threat towards a government agency and the hero aiding the government agency, those watching will understand that the character against the government is wrong. An added layer to this with American audiences, is that Auric Goldfinger is a European, they may see him as an enemy. When the film Goldfinger was released, there was an indication that actor Gert Frobe was a part of the Nazi party, which also embellished him as the villain in Goldfinger.</p>\n<p>In the original novel of Goldfinger, written by Ian Fleming, the narrative of the character Pussy Galore implied that she was a lesbian who led a criminal gang called the &lsquo;Cement Mixers&rsquo;. However, in the film the character was written as a heterosexual woman who leads a flight crew called the Flying Circus. Eventually, Pussy is seduced by Bond and becomes romantically involved with him.</p>\n<p>Most of the Bond films have been adaptations from Fleming&rsquo;s original novels due to the producers wishing to refrain from causing any sensations when they were released. Laucht and Gehrig discuss this in their articles. Laucht refers to the change of Cold War narratives. However, Gehrig exclaims that certain novels were changed to avoid political controversy. It is interesting to discover that the character of Goldfinger was kept the same, yet Pussy Galore&rsquo;s lesbian character was changed. This was because being a homosexual was not accepted in society for either men or women. In 1964, when the film was released, it was illegal for men to practice homosexuality. However, it has always been legal to be a homosexual woman, it was just not accepted in society. The production company wanted to apply to the majority audience and so it was decided to make this slight change in the character&rsquo;s sexual orientation.</p>\n<p>Goldeneye was released four years after the Cold War was over. The narrative of Goldeneye is based on a Russian Villian who wishes to control a powerful satellite weapon, the Goldeneye. Despite the Villian being a Russian, the setting introduces the Cold War finally ending, however Bond demonstrates to the audiences that he still needs to eliminate the enemy which is linked to the Soviet Union. This narrative is explained in Cutler&rsquo;s reading as he understands that when the Cold War was seen to end, Bond directors lost the fundamental theme to which all their narratives were linked - the Cold War. He explains that the directors needed to develop a narrative that would stay relevant and keep Bond audiences interested and not let the franchise become obsolete.</p>\n<p>In Goldeneye, Britain and Bond both go through new changes. The Cold War has ended, so Britain is relaxed and ready for its next accomplishments, whilst Bond is getting sloppier with his choices. For most of the challenges Bond faces trying to destroy the Soviet weapons factory, Britain is blamed. Britain does such a bad job that one of its agents turns against it and becomes the villain. This is because he wants to get revenge for the British government betraying his family.</p>\n<p>Bond faces living in a world after the Cold War which brings new changes that he is not ready for and is referenced to &lsquo;still being stuck in the past&rsquo;. He is especially challenged by the new M (portrayed by Judi Dench). For the previous thirty-three years of Bond films, there had always been a male M as the leader of MI6, however in Goldeneye, M is played by a woman, and she challenges Bond like nobody before. This new revelation gives a different meaning to Bond films and demonstrates that they are moving away from the Cold War narrative.</p>\n<p>This understanding demonstrates Burnett&rsquo;s article, where he talks about how Bond and Britain are separate components. Britain is a country taking challenges and defending itself from past mistakes. Bond is the symbol of the past trying to keep something alive that is no longer important or allowed.</p>\n<p>No Time To Die is the latest instalment of the James Bond franchise and was released thirty years after the Cold War ended. The narratives, characters and even James Bond have changed drastically from Goldfinger and Goldeneye. The main plot of this film is Bond fighting back against a terrorist group who are using technologies to kill. It is discovered that Bond had left MI6 but was enticed back by an old friend with connections to the CIA. The film concentrates on Bonds&rsquo;s mission to stop the terrorist group. Unlike other media projects, the CIA has a good connotation in the James Bond series. The American characters James Bond interacts are usually part of the CIA and always support Bond in achieving his goal and succeeding in his mission. These characters do not always survive, and this highlights Bond ultimately being an individual who must save the day on his own.</p>\n<p>This point is evaluated by Moran in his article about the CIA. He has the understanding that the CIA is seen as a positive force. In No Time To Die, this is highlighted by the CIA asking Bond to help with the mission. MI6 do not seem interested in fighting for Bond to be on their side. The CIA is a US intelligence agency and Bond is seen to be helping them and not Britain who have failed him.</p>\n<p>Goldfinger is famous for its sexualised women, from a naked woman painted gold to the name &lsquo;Pussy&rsquo;. Goldfinger is the third instalment of the James Bond series. At this point one of the key elements common in most Bond films has become a staple - the Bond Girls. In Goldfinger, Bond only has sex with two women, but he does have encounters with four different women.</p>\n<p>In the pre-credit sequence, he is seen with a half-naked woman who becomes a villain, meaning she was only meant to seduce him to lure him to be attacked. When Bond realises that she has been betrayed, he flings the girl to the side. We soon discover Bond does not care about the girl when he finds out they are a lure. The directors have known to state that this violence is acceptable because these women are seen as one of the enemies. The actions this woman takes to lure Bond is referenced in the reading by Hackett and Nolan. They have an understanding that the women in Bond films manipulate Bond with sex. However, this betrayal will have consequences. <br />Jill Masterson encounters Bond while she is spying for Goldfinger. Bond seduces her to retrieve information regarding Goldfinger; they have sex, and she receives a terrible punishment from Goldfinger. He kills her, strips her naked and paints her with gold paint. This act turns her from a person to an object. Racioppi and Tremonte speak on this in their reading that the women in Bond films are treated as objects. Jill, in this instance, is not only used by Bond for sex but then is turned into a golden object by Goldfinger.</p>\n<p>Bond encounters Jill&rsquo;s sister - Tilly Masterson. She is on a revenge mission to kill Goldfinger to get vengeance for her sister&rsquo;s death. At first, Tilly appears to have no interest in Bond until she needs his help to attack Goldfinger. This leads to Bond developing an interest in her. The narrative takes a surprise twist here, as the audience believe she is about to becomes the next Bond girl, when she is killed by Oddjob. Bond demonstrates some remorse, but he quickly moves on to the next person. He handles Tilly in a similar way to Jill; despite not having sex with her, but he uses her just to get information. Tilly is not vital to the storyline; Bond just uses her to gain information for the mission.</p>\n<p>Pussy Galore is the main female character in Goldfinger. Her character begins as a female villain and is one of Goldfinger&rsquo;s henchmen. When she is first introduced to the audience, she is stern and hard; she is strong and defends herself. However, when she meets Bond, this hard outer shell melts away. Furthermore, after her sexual encounter with Bond, she decides to change alliances and supports Bond in defeating Goldfinger. When viewing the film, audiences can see Pussy Galore trying hard to resist Bond, but as he throws her around in a barn scene to try and gather information about the mission, she falls for his charm. Galore is seen as the main Bond girl in the film since she solidifies a connection to Bond. Weathers touches on this in his reading; he has the view that the women in Bond films need Bond to have this connection with them so they can become complete. Bond needs to be the man who saves them from complicated situations and rescues them from the villain. Bond ensures this will happen with Galore; he pushes everything at her to make sure he gets what he wants, and she can then be branded as a Bond girl.</p>\n<p>Goldeneye introduced the first female M; this was a nod to the real-life head of MI5, Stella Rimington. M&rsquo;s character was never intended to be attractive to Bond, she is in charge; her role is to tell him what to do and control his decisions. M&rsquo;s exterior is nothing like the Bond girls, she is an elderly woman and is always dressed in smart pantsuits. In a reading by Leach, he compares the new gender change of M to Margret Thacher, who had been Prime Minister of Britain from 1979 - 1990. He has the understanding that M needs the passion that Thatcher had to try and bring Bond back stronger than ever. Bond soon learns that M is not someone to be toyed with, and he cannot seduce her like he does other Bond girls.</p>\n<p>The Bond girl in Goldeneye is a computer specialist in a Russian organisation her name is Natalya Simonova. She is more resistant to Bond than those before her. Natalya is assaulted by the villain, and instead of accepting her fate, she retaliates and hits back. Gradually, over time, she starts to feel emotion for Bond and eventually kisses him. They do eventually have sex, but the action is not glorified as it has been in previous films. However, after their encounter, she loses some of her tough ego and changes into more revealing clothes. Compared to earlier films, Bond requires Natalya to support him in the final mission for her skills. Funnell and Johnson explain in their reading that these roles are changing due to society having evolved in their views of women in films since the last film.</p>\n<p>No Time To Die has all the opposite connotations of gender than the previous Bond films. None of the women have an attraction to Bond except the main female character who becomes a wife symbol. Women work alongside Bond; these women are not seduced or sleep with Bond for him to gain any information from them; this is mirrored with Bond as he stays loyal to one woman. Bond leaves the MI6 organisation and is replaced with women of colour; this has not happened in any of the previous films. Garland speaks about how even though these Bond girls must change to fit in this society, elements of the Bond girls still exist. With No Time To Die, there are no elements of the original Bond girl concept, no seduction, no sexual actions and no sacrifices.</p>\n<p>The title sequence is one of the familiar elements which make a Bond film. In Goldfinger, audiences are exposed to naked models painted in gold, reminding us that women are just mere objects for men to control. Goldeneye uses silhouettes of women. In this case their actions involve posing alongside other images linked to the film (guns and statues), but the women do not become objects. In complete contrast, No Time To Die is different from the two mentioned. The title sequence only contains images of Bond himself, and no women feature at all.</p>\n<p>It is important to look at how these sequences have developed from the beginning of the franchise to the present day. Comparing society in the 1960s, to the 1990s and then 2020s, people&rsquo;s views on women and their value in films has evolved. Audiences start to recognise how women are represented in these sequences and have called for these to change over time.</p>\n<p>Bond&rsquo;s masculinity is developed throughout the Bond franchise: his tough exterior, love for women and use of gadgets and guns, fighting in hand-to-hand combat and operating independently. These elements link Bond to the action genre. In the reading written by Holt and Thompson, they describe the perfect action man as a man who is seen as everyone&rsquo;s winner as well as having the personality of a lone wolf. This is particularly demonstrated in earlier Bond films. Audiences support James Bond. Men wish they could be like him, doing his job, solving crime and defeating the villain and women wish they could be wooed by him. Bond does not have any weakness as he has no family or loved ones.</p>\n<p>This concept can be shown through Goldfinger because Bond is the hero when he saves Fort Knox and more importantly the gold from the bomb and potential explosion. He has relationships with four women to achieve his end goal and of course, kills the villain without any assistance from others. This is significant to earlier Bond films as he is the hero who by any means single-handedly saves the day, all for Queen and Country. <br />In Goldeneye, Bond again completes his mission and saves the day. However, unlike in previous films, he is unable to do this alone. It is thanks to the computer knowledge of Natalya, that the Goldeneye satellite is destroyed. Due to Bond&rsquo;s changed relation with M, he finds that he does not receive any accolades from her, she does not shower him with praise and compliments, this in turns squashes his ego and masculinity. In a change to previous Bond films, Bond does not have an array of Bond Girls who he seduces instead he remains with the one woman and relies on her for help throughout the mission turning his solo act into a partnership. Reflecting on changing ideals that men need women to support them, and women are strong enough to lead men.</p>\n<p>In No Time to Die, Bond no longer seduces women, he does not take part in one-night stands. Reflecting on ideals of society, women are not objects for men to take advantage of especially since the &lsquo;Me Too&rsquo; campaign. A change in the narrative that Bond no longer works for MI6; our 50s hero has evolved to understand that following Government orders blindly is not necessarily the right thing to do. The major change in the Bond character in this film is the revelation that Bond has a child which can be viewed as a weakness for the lone wolf character. These new revelations take away from the concept of Bond being isolated. These changes in Bond&rsquo;s character can be welcomed by audiences wishing to see a modern hero who would have s softer side &ndash; a sole partner and a child &ndash; reflecting men in the 2020s who put their families first.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />Conclusion</p>\n<p>The James Bond franchise is one of the longest-running and most successful film series in history. Despite the franchise&rsquo;s success, it has been criticised for its portrayal of women, the political messages it shares and its representation of the masculine action hero. However, from my research, I would argue that the themes portrayed in Bond films mainly reflect the shifting norms and evolving political landscape.</p>\n<p>Can a Cold War spy evolve with the changing political climate? Yes, he can. My research has shown that even though Bond began life as a spy constantly defending democracy from communism and the Soviet Union, after the end of the Cold War, the producers embraced Bond&rsquo;s reluctance to evolve as part of the narrative in Goldeneye and demonstrated the need for the MI6 spy to adapt to a changing political world. By No Time To Die, he is no longer fighting governments but protecting innocents from terrorist groups. He is not stopping nuclear missiles but preventing the spread of biochemicals.</p>\n<p>Many audiences have criticised Bond films&mdash;especially the older ones&mdash;for their sexist approach towards women. The franchise has a long history of portraying women in stereotypical roles as \"Bond girls\" who are often objectified, disposable, or exist mainly to further Bond's story. However, from my research I have found that the Bond girls have evolved into more complex, independent, and empowered female figures. However, as much as producers have introduced a female M, reduced the number of women seduced by Bond, and developed the characters to be more than the damsel in distress, there can still exist some contradictions.</p>\n<p>The representation of the traditional action hero has evolved the most since the hyper-masculine ideal in Goldfinger &ndash; using women and men to his own means to ensure Bond is successful on his mission at any costs; to the family-orientated Bond in No Time To Die, who puts his young daughter before both the mission and himself. These shifts not only signal changing expectations of the male identity but also the cultural shift in traditional gender roles.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the enduring appeal of Bond lies not just in its action and glamour, but in its ability to adapt while maintaining the core ingredients of the franchise. The Bond series is not just a vehicle for escapism and fantasy but can also reflect on the changing world that watches it. </p>",

This research analyses the &lsquo;outsider&rsquo; political identity formed through this strategy, the induction of political polarization through framing strategies, and the process of voter mobilization through populism strategies based on three theoretical perspectives. This case sets the three theories above as a theoretical framework and examines 50 tweets posted by Trump from June to November 2016 through content analysis based on qualitative case studies. Media ecological theory considers Twitter not as a simple information delivery tool but as a media environment that bypasses existing media to change perceptions and form political identities. In addition, framing theory analyses how framing messages such as &ldquo;Crooked Hillary&rdquo; and &ldquo;Obamacare is a disaster&rdquo; appeal to voters&rsquo; perceptions and emotions and how this strategy played a role in the process of strengthening political polarization. Finally, based on the populism theory, explores how Trump formed the &lsquo;people vs. elite&rsquo; structure through messages such as &ldquo;#DrainTheSwamp&rdquo; and &ldquo;#MAGA&rdquo; and the process of his voter mobilization strategy based on this. This research examines the process in which Trump&rsquo;s Twitter strategy goes beyond a means of delivering political messages and how identity formation, political polarization, and voter mobilization are interconnected and operate, creating a new form of political communication. This is a representative case that shows a new political communication method in the Twitter era and contributes to the study of political communication in the digital age.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 INTRODUCTION<br />Today, the changes in the media environment have brought about fundamental changes in the methods of political communication and election campaigns. While traditional mass media played a major role in the past election process, the influence of the Internet and social media (SNS) is now emphasized. Social media has become a part of the daily lives of web users, and messages can be delivered to segmented voters, and the delivery and reception of messages can be freely done without external interference. Users have built networks and contributed to the creation and distribution of a vast amount of social media content (Figueiredo et al., 2013). Social media is considered a new place for sharing and consuming news, influencing users' political participation. This change has also affected the strategies of election campaigns, and politicians are choosing to strengthen their political identity through social media, attempting to communicate directly with the public, and overcoming the limitations of traditional media (Morris, 2024). Twitter (X) is reported as the &ldquo;mass media&rdquo; that receives the most attention for its entertainment value among social media platforms (Lin et al., 2013, p. 39). The 2016 U.S. presidential election is considered a representative case where the role of social media was revealed. Donald Trump strategically utilized Twitter to understand voters and showed new political attempts and successful results through interaction (Naughton, 2016). Donald Trump actively utilized Twitter (X) and conducted an election campaign that was differentiated from existing politicians, and he used Twitter to form his political identity and provide strong distrust of opposing candidates and the media while using it to consolidate his supporters. This research evaluates how and through what processes Trump&rsquo;s Twitter strategy influences voter mobilization, political identity formation, and political polarization. While previous studies have investigated that social media plays a key role in providing information and mobilizing voters during the election process, this study expands this and examines the process of Trump&rsquo;s Twitter strategy in depth. Based on the Media Ecology theory, this research shows that Trump promoted polarization through confrontational and emotional framing and mobilized voters through populist strategies based on the way he utilized Twitter as a new political tool.</p>\n<p>Research Question (RQ):<br />RQ1. How did Trump construct his political identity through the environment of Twitter?<br />RQ2. How did Trump's Twitter framing strategy seek to create political polarization?<br />RQ3. How did Trump use populist strategies on Twitter to mobilize voters?<br />Based on the research questions above, this research sets the following objectives. Focused on media ecology theory, this research explores the process and strategy by which Trump created his own political identity as an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; by criticizing the existing mainstream media using the media characteristics of Twitter (X) and directly conveying it to voters, thereby weakening the influence and credibility of the media. Based on the generated identity, the research examines the process by which Trump&rsquo;s Twitter framing strategy aimed to shape the political polarization of voters. The research also explores how Trump&rsquo;s populist Twitter messages mobilized voters by leveraging the process of increasing political polarization. This research evaluates how Trump&rsquo;s Twitter strategy presents a new election campaign model in the modern political communication environment and discusses the political role and limitations of digital media. This research investigates the impact of Trump&rsquo;s communication strategy on the way political messages are formed and spread in the digital media environment and the process in which voters reinforce specific political positions and form political attitudes. Through this, the research aims to light on the role that social media plays in modern politics beyond simple election strategies and to expand academic thinking on the changes in political communication and election strategies in the digital age.</p>\n<p>2 LITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH BACKGROUND<br />2.1 Changes in the Digital Political Communication Environment<br />The change in the digital media environment has had a significant impact on the strategy of election campaigns and the method of political communication. While traditional mass media led the delivery of political information and agenda setting, social media has enabled a new form of political communication that directly delivers messages to more segmented voters and induces interaction. Zaller (1992) argued that exposure to a new political message changes political attitudes through cognitive processing stages. Unlike traditional media, new media enables horizontal and two-way information flow, and the delivery and reception of messages can occur freely without external interference. SNS goes beyond simple information provision and is used as a communication tool that promotes relationship formation and participation among voters. Nam (2012) argued that new media such as SNS play a role in mobilizing voters who were previously excluded from the system to the political process. He argued that the Internet plays a role in promoting political participation among various voters, including politically indifferent voters. These studies emphasize that SNS is a platform that goes beyond simple information transmission and induces network formation and direct political action among voters. However, Conover &amp; Feldman (1989) argued that voters do not simply judge candidates based on objective information alone, and subjective factors such as existing policy positions and party images greatly affect perceptions and pointed out that information dissemination through social media can sometimes distort political judgments (p. 914-916). In addition, Stier et al. (2018) pointed out that Twitter increases direct accessibility to candidates and influences public opinion formation, however, there is also a risk of information distortion and deepening polarization during the election period. In this context, it is necessary to specifically examine how Trump's Twitter strategy contributed to the formation of political identity and polarization, rather than simply mobilizing voters, as an example of social media's general political function.</p>\n<p>2.2 Trump's Use of Twitter: Political Context and Research Background<br />Trump used Twitter to emphasize his &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; image during the 2016 presidential election. By bypassing traditional media and delivering messages directly to voters, he effectively rallied his base. Enli (2017) claims that Trump has set the stage for independent communication by continuously criticizing the mainstream media through his Twitter activities (p. 35). Trump has used Twitter as an unfiltered platform and turned it into a powerful political weapon. (Barbaro, 2015). Zurcher (2016) noted that although Trump was initially considered unlikely to secure the Republican nomination or win the general election, his strategy of mass mobilization via social media especially Twitter played a significant role in his electoral victory. However, Jiang et al. (2021) reported that Twitter&rsquo;s algorithm creates an echo chamber and promotes political polarization. Kubin &amp; Sikorsky (2021) argues, this suggests that the more users are exposed to ideologically similar media content, the more polarized they become. This insight suggests that social media can promote positive political participation and negative political behavior. Koutroubas &amp; Galanakis (2022) argue that users engage in extreme political behavior by learning repetitive political messages. Putting these studies together, Trump&rsquo;s Twitter strategy worked to emphasize political identity and induce political polarization, not as a means of conveying information. It is widely known that social media plays an important role in modern election campaigns, but studies on detailed processes and methods are lacking. Therefore, this research aims to deeply examine the strategies and processes through which Trump&rsquo;s strategies shape his political identity, promote political polarization, and ultimately promote voter mobilization.</p>\n<p>2.3 Media Ecology and Political Communication: Trump&rsquo;s Use of Twitter in the 2016 US Presidential Election<br />McLuhan (1964) structured media as a tool for conveying various information, and considered human thought patterns and society to understand one environmental configuration and through the concept of &ldquo;The medium is the message,&rdquo; he argued that the media itself has a decisive influence on shaping human thought patterns and social relationships, and that the essence of media lies not in the content it conveys, but in the influence it has on human society (p. 8-9). In other words, as specific media technologies develop, social interaction and political communication methods can fundamentally change. Similarly, Scolari (2012) explained the process in which the transition from print media to electronic media changed the social structure, viewing humans as living in a media environment and the media as an environment that shapes the way they perceive and think about the world. From this perspective, Twitter (X) can be evaluated as a representative example of the media ecology theory that operated as an environment in which Trump&rsquo;s political identity was formed and spread, rather than a simple tool for conveying information. This study provides examples of the use of the above theories. Jackson (2020) argues that Twitter delivers short and powerful messages while maintaining speed and brevity. This shows that Trump used the characteristics of Twitter to establish his &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; political identity and establish a way to communicate directly with voters using direct and emotional language. Additionally, McLuhan (1964) emphasized that media formats shape the meaning, structure, and social response to a message (p. 2) This is not a simple technological change, but rather a media ecological element that changes voters&rsquo; perception system and political attitudes. Ruotsalainen &amp; Heinonen (2015) pointed out that the technological deterministic interpretation of this theory may overlook the social context, and Strate (2008) criticized it for focusing only on the media and failing to properly reflect the meaning and consequences of the message. The reason why Trump's strategy was effective is largely due to the public's dissatisfaction with the existing political system and the influence of the various frames and communication strategies used by Trump (Collinson, 2016).<br />Nonetheless, Yaqub et al. (2017) argue that Twitter played an important role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Ott (2016) argues that Twitter provides an environment where discourse is based on immediacy and does not require formal etiquette, and that Trump has adapted to this environment to reconfigure political discourse and identity. In addition, Crandall et al. (2018) argue that Twitter, rather than traditional media, was used in election campaigns to influence public perception and change. For example, Meeks (2019) reported that Trump attacked the mainstream media through Twitter and caused the public to distrust the media, and Oliver &amp; Rahn (2016) argue that Trump used the above strategies for his &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; identity. From a media ecology perspective, the Twitter environment was an environment for forming his political identity. Existing studies provide practical theoretical frameworks, but they only focus on Trump&rsquo;s strategies through the concepts of simple media ecology theory and limited data. This research overcomes these limitations by considering the media ecology perspective, frame, and populism framework, and analyses how Trump's Twitter strategy shaped the formation of an outsider identity through a large amount of data.</p>\n<p>2.4 Politicization of Framing Strategy: Trump's Use of Twitter<br />Entman's (1993) framing theory provides a central framework for explaining how the composition of a message influences how recipients perceive and interpret issues and shape their political identities. Gerbaudo et al. (2019) argue that the influence of digital media is determined by emotional composition and narrative style rather than the amount of information, and as a result, negative emotional content has a greater impact on voters than positive content. Scheufele (2006) argues that framing theory emphasizes a specific reality in a text to make people perceive the cause of a problem, responsibility, emotions, and solutions in a specific way. Trump's 2016 presidential campaign is a representative strategy of framing theory in practice, a communication method that induces political polarization through emotional stimulation and division (Lee &amp; Xu, 2018). These framing strategies work more powerfully amid the changing media ecosystem: the transition from one-way mass media to two-way digital platforms. While traditional media played a role in information delivery, social media played an important role in political mobilization and public opinion formation, including networking functions. Social media has a structure that immediately expands emotional responses through user participation and real-time feedback (Bennett &amp; Segerberg, 2012).</p>\n<p>However, these functions do not necessarily produce only positive results. The effect of the framing strategy can sometimes work in the direction of deepening political bias and polarization. Earle &amp; Hodson (2022) emphasized the effect of repeated exposure to negative frames on the formation of voters' attitudes and investigated that the effect is maximized especially in media such as Twitter (p. 3). Trump went beyond simply delivering negative messages and used emotional appeal frames to stimulate voters' anger, anxiety, and division. Olaniran &amp; Williams (2020) explored that his Twitter strategy utilized a strategy of persuading the public by providing emotional messages and inflammatory news and stimulating the public's emotions (p. 83-86). Trump prompts voters to react emotionally to issues and sets up to link to his \"outsider\" political identity. Sahly et al. (2019) argued that Trump used the framing to blame the opposing party for political and economic failures, thereby causing public anger and anxiety. Homolar &amp; Scholz (2019) contended that Trump framed his rival candidate Hillary Clinton as a representative figure of corrupt politicians through Twitter, conveying the perception of her as an icon of failed elites to the public (p. 351). In other words, Rathje (2017) argued that Trump's framing strategy was not simply to emphasize issues, but to reconstruct specific issues emotionally, leading voters to feel a sense of rejection toward the opposing camp, as emotional framing did not stop at simply changing perceptions but also led to political polarization. While previous studies have focused on the existence of Trump&rsquo;s framing strategy itself, this study aims to deeply explore the characteristics and methods through which this strategy promoted polarization. Trump&rsquo;s framing was not simply a rhetorical strategy, but rather a political tool that changed voters' perceptions and behaviors through Twitter, which provides important implications for understanding the evolution of election strategies and changes like political communication.</p>\n<p>2.5 Theoretical Perspectives on Populism and Trump&rsquo;s Twitter Strategy<br />According to Urbinati (2019), populism is not limited to a specific ideology or political system but is a political practice that seeks to challenge and change the existing dominant order. It is characterized by presenting arguments that represent the interests of the &ldquo;masses,&rdquo; but at the same time setting up elites or vested interests as external &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; and forming a structure of opposition and confrontation. It is not directly connected to specific policies or political sanctions and can be applied across left and right ideologies (p. 112-113). In addition to the above study, Mueller (2019) argues that populists use strategies that emphasize crisis and communicate with the public, setting up crises and enemies, and mobilizing public anxiety and anger. This strategy is further emphasized in times of economic instability and social conflict. The study below provides an accurate example of a populist strategy in Trump&rsquo;s 2016 election campaign. B&eacute;land (2019) argues that Trump used a Twitter strategy based on anti-immigrant sentiment and nationalistic messages based on the frame of &ldquo;national collective narcissism&rdquo; to strengthen his political gains. However, according to Mudde Cas (2015), populism is characterized by claiming to represent the &ldquo;people&rdquo; ignoring various interests and opinions and rejecting the opinions of political opponents. Regarding the negative aspects of populism provided by the above study, Henley (2025) provides research results that far-right populists are more likely to spread fake news on social media than politicians from mainstream or far-left parties, indicating that right-wing populists destabilize democracy. This conveys the importance of how Trump&rsquo;s populist strategy spread on social media.</p>\n<p>Trump effectively provoked public discontent and conflict with elites through a populist strategy that was distinct from traditional political discourse. Lacatus (2018) analyses Trump&rsquo;s Twitter (X) during the election campaign and found that Trump&rsquo;s discourse was aggressive and derogatory, openly criticizing Washington&rsquo;s political elites (p. 226). This suggests that he used a strategy to induce public resentment toward the existing political order. As an example of the above study, Rudolph (2019) argues that Donald Trump also used the &ldquo;Drain the Swamp&rdquo; slogan to exploit voters&rsquo; populist anger toward the federal government, while at the same time inducing voters&rsquo; anger and emphasizing his image as a populist advocate for the public (The Guardian, 2025). As a result, the strategy provided by the above study had a strong influence on voters who had strong resentment toward the existing political system. However, existing research focuses only on the status quo of Trump's populist discourse and based on previously formed political identity and strategies to induce political polarization, there is a lack of research in which he detailed how actual populist tweets mobilize voters through populist messages.</p>\n<p>According to the literature review, that Trump&rsquo;s Twitter strategy functioned as an important element in forming political identity, political polarization, and voter mobilization. While it is well known that social media is essential to election campaigns, its broader political implications have not been fully explored. From a media ecology perspective, there is a lack of in-depth research on Twitter&rsquo;s strategy to position himself as a major source of information without media intermediation to criticize traditional media and maintain an outsider political identity. There is still insufficient analysis of the processes through which framing strategies and populist messages influence voters' perceptions and political attitudes. To supplement this research gap, this research examined Trump&rsquo;s 2016 Twitter strategy through media ecology, framing, and populism. Through this, research aims to examine how Twitter (X) constructed political messages and influenced voter behavior in modern political communication. Furthermore, the goal is to deeply explore Trump&rsquo;s strategy to construct his political identity through the Twitter environment, promote political polarization based on this, and effectively mobilize voters.</p>\n<p>3 METHODOLOGY <br />This research uses qualitative research methodology and content analysis to examine Trump&rsquo;s Twitter (X) strategy during the 2016 US presidential election. Thus, a Case Study Approach was adopted, and the analysis data consists of tweets posted by Trump. A case study is an effective approach for exploring complex contexts and strategies such as political communication in depth and transparency (Priya, 2021). Research focuses on interpreting political message strategies centered on a case study and deriving social and structural meanings beyond simple descriptions of phenomena. Qualitative research is useful for deeply exploring complex problems in the real world and interpreting the perceptions, emotions, and behaviors of message producers (Tenny et al., 2022). However, since the goal is to collect as much data as possible to derive accurate research results, the characteristics of mixed research that combines qualitative and quantitative research, which compresses 31 data in the framing strategy section, can be confirmed through the graph in Appendix A. Trump&rsquo;s Twitter strategy has gone beyond simple information transmission and combined media ecology, emotional framing, and populism strategies to form political identity, cause polarization, and mobilize voters. To analyses these strategies, a qualitative approach that focuses on &lsquo;who, when, how, and why is affected&rsquo; is required (Busetto et al., 2020), which complements the limitations of quantitative research that focuses on statistical generalization (Alshrief, 2023). This research uses content analysis as a core research method and analyses the meaning of repeated language by focusing on expressions that utilize Twitter as an environment for forming political identity, aggressive expressions, political rhetoric, emotional language, and symbolic content of populism through collected tweet data. Content analysis is effective in systematically classifying specific messages and their meanings and understanding human thoughts and emotional responses (Columbia University, 2024). The analysis process investigates cases of tweets in which Twitter, a platform operates as a media environment for forming political identity beyond a simple means of communication through media ecology analysis, frame analysis analyses message composition and strategy, and discourse analysis examines how power criticism, emotional language, and populist discourse are combined. Ultimately, the analysis demonstrates that Trump&rsquo;s Twitter strategy integrated media ecology, framing, and populist discourse to function as a strategy for forming Trump&rsquo;s political identity, political polarization, and voter mobilization.</p>\n<p>Data collection was conducted by selecting 50 tweets posted from June to November 2016, and data was collected using Trump's official Twitter account (@realDonaldTrump) and the \"Trump Twitter Archive.\" First, content that criticized the mainstream media or defined as an untrustworthy medium and emphasized the Twitter environment, second, tweets that repeatedly used a specific political frame, third, messages that induce emotional responses to election issues, and lastly, tweets that induce political participation by forming a structure of opposition between the establishment and the public. The collected tweets were classified and investigated based on media ecology, framing strategy, and populism strategy. The analysis data was presented as tables and visual materials (photos, tables, graphs). In particular, the framing strategy selected representative tweets and presented them in a table to concisely present the 31 massive data, and an explanation of the entire data is provided in Appendix A through a bar graph. The analysis focuses on Trump&rsquo;s strategy of forming his political identity and mobilizing voters by criticizing the existing mainstream media and elites through the Twitter environment and utilizing emotional and ideological strategies. It explored how the three theories above interact and operate in digital political communication strategies.</p>\n<p>The data analysis uses a case study approach based on qualitative research methodology. The aim is to investigate Twitter's strategies in the digital media era by deeply exploring the case of Trump&rsquo;s strategy. The analysis is based on three theoretical frameworks derived from the literature review: media ecology, framing strategies, and populism strategies. Based on the media ecology theory, the analysis assumes that Twitter is not a simple means of communication, but a new media environment that constructs and disseminates one&rsquo;s own identity by criticizing existing media. Second, based on Trump&rsquo;s aggressive framing strategy, the analysis examines the aggressive strategy and emotional appeal of tweets criticizing Hillary Clinton and Obama and tweets about the economy/jobs and security issues. Finally, the analysis of populism strategies analyses tweets in which Trump forms an &ldquo;us versus them&rdquo; structure, targets political elites and mainstream media as targets of exclusion and criticism, and calls for public representation and political participation.</p>\n<p>In Donald Trump's 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, the Twitter (X) strategy was the first time Twitter was used as a key tool in a full-fledged election campaign, demonstrating a paradigm shift in political communication (Gibson, 2019). Trump has leveraged Twitter to define mainstream media as \"fake news,\" emphasize his \"outsider\" identity, and communicate directly with the public through aggressive messages (Ross &amp; Rivers, 2018). Emotional frames such as &ldquo;Crooked Hillary&rdquo; significantly affected voters' perceptions and emotions, resulting in reduced trust and political polarization (Jamieson, 2016). In addition, populist rhetoric such as \"#MAGA\" highlighted \"us versus them\" structures and mobilized voters (Abramowitz &amp; McCoy, 2019). The results of this research show that the strategies presented above are a prime example of politicians' identity building, political polarization, and voter mobilization on a social media platform called Twitter. Trump's case thus provides important implications not only for this research but also for future research on social media-based political campaigns.</p>\n<p>4 ANALYSIS/DISCUSSION OF DATA COLLECTED<br />This chapter examines Donald Trump's 2016 Twitter strategy through actual tweets and investigates how Trump's Twitter message was designed to strategically shape his political identity, induce political polarization, and mobilize voters. The purpose of this data analysis is not to measure and analyse the results of his Twitter strategy but to focus on how his strategy is structured, expressed, and communicated to the public. The analysis focuses on how Trump's Twitter strategy was strategically structured and operated in a digital media environment, focusing on three key research questions that applied media ecology, framing theory, and populism theory.</p>\n<p>Research Questions (RQ):<br />RQ1. How did Trump construct his political identity through the environment of Twitter?<br />RQ2. How did Trump's Twitter framing strategy seek to create political polarization?<br />RQ3. How did Trump use populist strategies on Twitter to mobilize voters?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4.1 DATA ANALYSIS<br />Donald Trump&rsquo;s use of Twitter in the 2016 presidential campaign shaped the change in the traditional political communication structure from the perspective of media ecology. According to media ecology, media outlets go beyond the role of simple information transmission and are environmental elements that change social interaction and perception (Islas &amp; Bernal, 2016). At a time when public distrust of the mainstream media was growing, Trump attempted to bypass the media and portray himself as a &ldquo;politician outside the establishment&rdquo; by delivering messages directly through Twitter. This analysis investigates the process by which Trump systematically weakened trust in the mainstream media through Twitter, strengthened Twitter as an alternative medium, and directly conveyed his &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; identity to voters through this.</p>\n<p><br />Figure 1<br />Attacking Mainstream Media to Shape Outsider Identity: Trump&rsquo;s Use of Twitter as a Media Ecology Strategy. <br />Note. (Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed, August 1, 2016d)</p>\n<p>First, it is a strategy to weaken the credibility of existing media by utilizing the direct and immediate information delivery characteristics of Twitter. He emphasized the claim that existing media is reporting biasedly toward a certain political force through the expression \"one-sided and biased.\" This played a key role in changing the public's perception of existing media as objective and neutral information providers and forming a negative image that the media cannot be trusted. In addition, he used concise and provocative expressions such as \"failing @nytimes is a joke\" and \"CNN is laughable\" to convey the image of the NYT and CNN as unreliable media to the public. He claimed that credibility was weakened through \"failing @nytimes is a joke.\" In addition, he emphasized the perception that CNN is a media that is not worth trusting and should not be taken seriously by directly mocking CNN's reports through the expression \"CNN is laughable.\" Trump reinforced the negative perception of CNN by tweeting, &ldquo;CNN is the worst &ndash; fortunately they have bad ratings because everyone knows they are biased.&rdquo;, citing CNN&rsquo;s low viewership ratings as evidence of bias and lack of trust (Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed, October 10, 2016a). This strategy of distrusting the media led voters to trust Trump&rsquo;s Twitter messages more than the existing media. He used direct attacks to reinforce the perception that he was intentionally excluded from the mainstream media, and he used the platform of Twitter to convey his identity as an outsider who opposes the established order.</p>\n<p><br />Figure 2 <br />Delegitimizing Traditional Media to Construct Outsider Identity: Trump&rsquo;s Criticism of The New York Times as a Media Ecology Strategy.<br />Note. (Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed, October 15, 2016)</p>\n<p>Second, Trump utilized the media characteristics of Twitter to emphasize the political bias of the media and built an image that the media had lost its fairness. He used expressions such as &ldquo;don&rsquo;t even call us anymore&rdquo; and &ldquo;making up sources&rdquo; toward the New York Times, claiming that the existing media was spreading fake news without going through the reporting process. This strategy was effective in conveying the message that the media was on the side of the Democratic Party and part of the political goal of excluding him. Through this, it became an opportunity to question the reliability of the information production and delivery process performed by the existing media, and through this, it led voters to reconsider the way and process of receiving news from the mainstream media, and it functioned as a space that weakened the neutrality and trust of the existing press and strengthened the identity of an &ldquo;outsider.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><br />Figure 3<br />Describing the media as politically compromised: Trump attacks CNN, strengthening the identity of outsiders. Note. (Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed, August 1, 2016a)</p>\n<p>Trump attempted to further weaken the credibility of CNN by claiming that the existing media supports the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, even though they report unfavorably to him. He used the expression &ldquo;press shop for Hillary Clinton&rdquo; to describe CNN as a tool for Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s political interests. This suggests that CNN does not maintain political neutrality and fulfills its role as an objective media outlet. Through this, Trump instilled in voters the perception that CNN is not a provider of fair information, but an organization that represents a specific political position. This went beyond simple criticism of the media and served as a device to establish his position outside the existing power structure. Trump described CNN as a biased media outlet by tweeting, &ldquo;Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding &ndash;&ndash; or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?&rdquo; claiming that CNN intentionally does not report on issues unfavorable to Hillary Clinton (Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed, August 1, 2016c). Trump effectively implemented a media ecological strategy that built the image of the existing media as an institution with a biased political agenda for voters and highlighted the directness and reliability of the information provided on Twitter. In this process, Twitter functioned as a media environment where Trump directly constructed and distributed his own political identity, beyond being a distribution channel for information.</p>\n<p><br />Figure 4<br />Using Twitter as Space of Truth and Validation: Trump&rsquo;s Hashtag Strategy to Reinforce Outsider Identity. <br />Note. (Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed, September 27, 2016b).</p>\n<p>Trump used hashtags like &ldquo;#TrumpWon&rdquo; and &ldquo;#1 trend on Twitter&rdquo; to try to spread the perception among the public that his victory was already certain, regardless of mainstream media coverage. This was a strategy to position Twitter as a more trustworthy alternative truth space than the existing media. This was a strategy to position Twitter as a more trustworthy alternative truth space than the existing media. Trump expressed his skepticism about the reliability of the mainstream media by tweeting, &ldquo;The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change &ndash; doubt it?&rdquo; (Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed, November 13, 2016). Trump used the digital media environment of Twitter as an effective means to distrust the mainstream media. This shows that he conveyed his identity as an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; who resists power to voters. From a media ecological perspective, this suggests that Twitter is not simply a means of conveying information but rather functions as an environmental foundation for the formation of political identity and the rearrangement of existing power.</p>\n<p>In Donald Trump&rsquo;s 2016 US presidential campaign, Twitter (X) went beyond a simple communication tool and became a strategic weapon for effectively delivering political messages. Trump, who established an outsider identity in the Twitter environment, approached voters using aggressive framing strategies based on this and adopted a method to promote political polarization among voters by maximizing emotional appeals through these strategies. Trump's Twitter strategy relies on four main frames: criticism of Hillary, criticism of Obama, the economy and jobs, and crime and national security. His tweets demonstrate a strategy that goes beyond messaging to appeal to voters' emotions, using aggressive and emotional framing. The visual data below provides representative tweets selected from among 31 tweets of Trump from June to November 2016, and the entire data and analysis summary of the frame strategy can be found through the bar graph included in Appendix A, and the full list of tweets cited in the text is included in the reference list. The table below shows representative tweets selected from 31 tweets.</p>\n<p><br /> <br />Figure 5<br />Framing Strategies Used by Trump Tweets during the 2016 U.S. presidential Campaign.<br />Note. Data collected by the author from Donald J. Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed between June and November 2016. Some tweets contained multiple framing strategies, so total counts exceed the number of tweets</p>\n<p>The framing strategy is an important political communication strategy that emphasizes a specific issue or person and guides voters&rsquo; perception in a certain direction (Chong &amp; Druckman, 2007, p. 106). Trump framed Hillary Clinton negatively and at the same time positioned himself as an alternative leader who stands against the establishment system. This framing strategy strengthened the supporters&rsquo; &ldquo;us&rdquo; identity and &ldquo;them&rdquo; perception of the opposing camp, accelerating political polarization. Trump utilized frames on Twitter to make Clinton a representative example of a corrupt establishment politician. Trump&rsquo;s most representative framing strategy is to describe Hillary Clinton as &ldquo;Crooked Hillary.&rdquo; This is shown in the Appendix A chart, and it appeared most frequently among the total number of tweets, 31. Trump framed the tweet as follows: &ldquo;Look at the way Crooked Hillary is handling the e-mail case and the total mess she is in. She is unfit to be president. Bad judgement!&rdquo;. Through this tweet, Trump created the following frame. Through &ldquo;Crooked Hillary,&rdquo; he emphasized her corruption, and through direct accusations such as &ldquo;total mess&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad judgement,&rdquo; he created the frame that Clinton is an untrustworthy person. Also, through &ldquo;Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin' Hillary&rdquo; (Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed, June 2, 2016), he implicitly recognized that her statement was a lie through the expression &ldquo;Lyin' Hillary&rdquo; and formed a negative image of Clinton through the words &ldquo;Crooked Hillary.&rdquo; These messages went beyond criticizing Hillary, portraying them as corrupt members of the political elite.</p>\n<p>Trump applied the Framing strategy by claiming that &ldquo;Obamacare&rdquo; increases economic burden, causes rising medical costs, and reduces jobs, and he framed her as a typical negative politician who causes economic incompetence and the side effects of government intervention. He emphasized the frame that &ldquo;Obamacare&rdquo; is a failed policy by tweeting, &ldquo;Obamacare is a disaster! Time to repeal &amp; replace! #ObamacareFail&rdquo;. He used the expression &ldquo;disaster&rdquo; to frame the negative image that Obamacare is causing a lot of economic and social damage to the American economy and people and conveyed his political identity to the public by promising that he would change this failed policy as president through the phrase &ldquo;Time to repeal &amp; replace!&rdquo; In addition, he linked the problem of &ldquo;Obamacare&rdquo; to Hillary and emphasized that this policy would continue if she became president. Refer to the contents of Appendix A.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump's Twitter strategy goes beyond simple information dissemination to aggressive framing, positioning himself as a leader by highlighting voters' economic anxiety, fear, and anger. This economic issue was considered an important social issue during the election campaign. He used a strategy to instill anxiety and a sense of crisis in voters by emphasizing the economic crisis in the United States. His tweet shows the content of &ldquo;Crooked Hillary has never created a job in her life. We will create 25 million jobs. Think she can do that? Not a chance. #BigLeagueTruth&rdquo;. The expression &ldquo;never created a job,&rdquo; Hillary conveyed that she does not create jobs and promoted voters&rsquo; anxiety, while he conveyed that he would create jobs with the phrase &ldquo;We will create 25 million jobs.&rdquo; Furthermore, Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s tax hikes will CRUSH our economy. In his tweet, &ldquo;I will cut taxes &ndash; BIG LEAGUE.&rdquo; (Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed, October 20, 2016c). The expression &ldquo;tax hikes&rdquo; created anxiety among voters about Hillary&rsquo;s economic policies, created fear through &ldquo;CRUSH our economy&rdquo;, and presented himself as the solution to economic anxiety through the expression &ldquo;I will cut taxes.&rdquo; Trump emphasized the increase in crime and threats to national security in the United States. &ldquo;This election is a choice between law, order &amp; safety &ndash; or chaos, crime &amp; violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou\". In this tweet, he emphasized a stable social order by using the expression &ldquo;Law, order &amp; safety,&rdquo; but he also aimed at political polarization by conveying to the public the threat that would arise if Hillary were to be elected through the confrontational expression &ldquo;Chaos, crime &amp; violence.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign is evaluated as a case that utilized the media characteristics of Twitter (X) by breaking away from traditional political communication methods. Trump, who formed an \"outsider\" identity and used a political polarization strategy through a framing strategy, attempted to mobilize voters through populist messages based on the above strategies. Trump successfully utilized a populist strategy on Twitter to criticize existing political elites and induce and incite public political participation (Cox, 2018). This analysis derives the types of populist strategy based on Trump's tweets and largely classifies Trump's tweets into five populist strategies. Each strategy attempted to exert political influence on the public through tweets. The table below is a summary of the types of populist strategies, representative tweets, and the analysis of them. The analysis was mainly conducted on the strategy of 'attacking political elites', 'anti-establishment messages', 'us versus them structures', 'emphasizing patriotism and nationalism', and 'directly mobilizing of the public'.</p>\n<p><br />Figure 6<br />Types of Populist Strategies in Trump&rsquo;s Tweets during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election.<br />Note. Data collected by the author from Donald J. Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed between August and November 2016. Examples represent key rhetorical strategies used in campaign tweets.</p>\n<p>Trump used expressions to describe the existing political elites as a corrupt group. These expressions were used to criticize elite politicians who only looked after their interests. He posted content titled &ldquo;PAY TO PLAY POLITICS #CrookedHillary&rdquo; in another tweet (Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed, October 12, 2016) This criticized the political funds used by Hillary Clinton and described her as a corrupt political elite, thereby increasing public resentment by driving Hillary into the symbol of the corrupt political elite. In addition, he delivered content through the expression strategy of &ldquo;#PayToPlay,&rdquo; Hillary used a strategy of making herself appear as a corrupt politician who hangs out with the elite politicians and is distant from the general public, and Trump sends a populist message criticizing the reality that only the wealthy exert political influence and the general public is excluded from political participation. Through these tweet contents, Trump used a populist strategy of setting up the existing political elites as a corrupt group and inducing the mobilization of political elites and the public. On the other hand, his own administration claimed that all Americans are equal through the expression &ldquo;EVERY American will be treated equally&rdquo; (Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed, October 10, 2016c). Along with this elite attack strategy, Trump repeatedly utilized anti-establishment messages based on his identity as an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; established on Twitter as someone who does not belong to the establishment system. The representative tweet &ldquo;I agree, @MMFlint- To all Americans, I see you &amp; I hear you. I am your voice. Vote to #DrainTheSwamp&rdquo;, includes the phrase &ldquo;I see you &amp; I hear you. I am your voice&rdquo;. In this part, Trump describes himself as an outsider representing the voice of the people. In addition, in the tweet posted, &ldquo;This is a MOVEMENT that will never be seen again-it's our last chance to #DrainTheSwamp&rdquo;, he expressed anti-establishment sentiment (Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed, November 7, 2016c). He used the expression, &ldquo;our last chance,&rdquo; to convey the meaning that this was the last chance to stop the rule of vested political powers, and through &ldquo;Movement,&rdquo; he conveyed the idea that change is brought about through public effort.</p>\n<p>These anti-establishment messages go beyond mere criticism of political elites and create a clear confrontational structure between Trump supporters and the establishment. In this context, Trump has continued to reinforce the &lsquo;Us vs. Them&rsquo; structure and deepened political polarization. The table described is content posted on August 21, and the phrase &ldquo;common purpose and common dreams&rdquo; defines &ldquo;us&rdquo; only as a group that shares the same beliefs as Trump. In addition, although the target of &ldquo;them&rdquo; is not directly expressed through the phrase &ldquo;America together as ONE country again,&rdquo; the expression above suggests the existence of a group that has divided the United States, which can be interpreted as establishment politicians, the Democratic Party, and Democratic Party voters. And &ldquo;Make America Great Again with #MAGA content&rdquo; is a slogan, but currently, it emphasizes the crisis of America and implies the meaning of making America the way it was before. It symbolizes the values that &ldquo;we&rdquo; must recreate, and it means the failure of &ldquo;them.&rdquo; The tweet posted on October 20 clearly provides the &lsquo;Us vs. Them&rsquo; structure, &ldquo;This is an incredible MOVEMENT-WE are going to take our country BACK!&rdquo; (Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed, October 20, 2016d). The &ldquo;WE are going to take our country BACK!&rdquo; defines voters as the group that will solve America&rsquo;s crisis and argues that America is currently monopolized by the elite, not the masses., and &ldquo;them&rdquo;. In addition, through the tweet &ldquo;we are going to WIN back the White House!&rdquo;, it conveys the message that we should reclaim the White House that belongs to the public (Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed, November 8, 2016). Through the Us and Them Frame strategy, it held the public accountable and shifted the responsibility for America&rsquo;s crisis to &ldquo;them&rdquo; who are the vested interests, the Democratic Party, and the media.</p>\n<p>Trump, who built a relationship with voters through the &lsquo;us vs. them&rsquo; structure, connected his supporters to actual political participation. In the tweets mentioned in the table above, he advocated a return to the image of the past, away from the current crisis in the United States, with the slogan \"Make America Great Again. &ldquo;Also, Trump delivered a patriotic expression through the tweet, &ldquo;Together we can save American JOBS, American LIVES, and AMERICAN FUTURES! #Debates&rdquo; (Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed, October 20, 2016e). The expression &ldquo;American JOBS, American LIVES, and AMERICAN FUTURES&rdquo; contains a message to protect the precious things of the country, and the expression &ldquo;we can save&rdquo; emphasizes responsibility and national solidarity. For example, in the following tweet posted by Trump right before the 2016 presidential election, as mentioned in the table, the sentence &ldquo;We are winning and the press is refusing to report it&rdquo; criticized the bias of the media and conveyed a sense of crisis to voters that the truth was being obscured, and the phrase &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them fool you &ndash; get out and vote!&rdquo; conveyed the need for direct voting and political interest for the truth. Additionally, he delivered the tweet content &ldquo;LIVE on #Periscope: Join me for a few minutes in Pennsylvania. Get out &amp; VOTE tomorrow.&rdquo;. The expression &ldquo;Join me for a few minutes&rdquo; meant that he was inviting the public to become participants in politics, and the phrase &ldquo;Get out &amp; VOTE tomorrow&rdquo; delivered a mobilization message demanding political participation.</p>\n<p>The analysis focused on Trump&rsquo;s 2016 U.S. presidential election Twitter strategy through qualitative content analysis, focusing on how his political identity formation process (RQ1), the way he used an aggressive framing strategy to create political polarization (RQ2), and the way he mobilized his supporters politically through populist messages (RQ3). These RQs are interconnected and constitute a single political communication strategy. First, through the characteristics of the Twitter environment, he criticized the existing media outlets and formed an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; identity that opposed the vested interests and emphasized Twitter as a mainstream information medium. In other words, Twitter functioned as an environment of media ecology that criticized the existing media and formed its own identity, thereby changing public perception and political discourse. Second, based on this identity, Trump used a strategy to frame Hillary as a &ldquo;corrupt politician&rdquo; and reinforce her negative image. He also used aggressive framing strategies related to the economic and security crisis, framing Hillary as the cause of the crisis and stoking public anger and anxiety. This provides an example of inducing political polarization of voters based on public sentiment. Finally, in a polarized political environment, Trump presented the &ldquo;Us vs. Them&rdquo; structure through a populist message strategy and mobilized the public to participate in politics. As a result, Trump&rsquo;s Twitter strategy was to form a political identity as an &ldquo;outsider to the establishment system&rdquo; and communicate with the public, strengthen solidarity through a frame strategy, and induce polarization, based on this, it was possible to conclude that it led to the political effect of mobilizing voters with a message based on populism.</p>\n<p>4.2 DISCUSSION<br />This research investigated the interaction, process, and method of three phenomena: political identity construction, mass mobilization, and political polarization, based on three theoretical frameworks (media ecology, framing, and populism theory). For this analysis, three research questions were set up as interrelated structures. First, the analysis of RQ1 showed that in the Twitter era, Trump defined himself as an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; by criticizing traditional media as &ldquo;failing @nytimes&rdquo; through the independent Twitter environment and characteristics. This is a criticism that has been carried out to make Twitter a major media environment. Also, this was done to continuously appeal to the public politically through tweets, emphasizing that he had an identity that did not belong to them. This aligns with McLuhan (1964) concept of &ldquo;The medium is the message&rdquo; that the media itself has a decisive influence on forming human thought patterns and social relationships and that the essence of media lies in its influence on human society, not in the content it delivers. In other words, Trump used the new media environment called Twitter itself to establish his &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; political identity in line with the characteristics of the digital platform, rather than simply delivering messages, and spreading new political discourse and communication methods. Also. It reconstructs the meaning and structure of political messages and even voter perceptions in the format of Twitter, showing the perspective of media ecology in which media formats together shape messages and voter responses. This provides a representative example of the concept of environmental factors that change in the media environment changes human perception and social structure, as argued by Gamaleri (2019). However, this analysis has limitations in analysing strategies using only the above theories. Media ecology provides the influence of the media environment on social structure, but the Twitter strategy utilized by Trump is limited in analysing the strategy of inducing political polarization and mobilizing the public, so tried to analyse his strategy by applying framing theory and populism theory together.</p>\n<p>The results of the analysis for RQ2 show the strategic way in which Trump used the framing strategy based on his &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; identity to induce political polarization. Trump linked her to corrupt politicians and the icon of the economic failure and crisis of the United States through messages such as &ldquo;Crooked Hillary,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lyin&rsquo; Hillary,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Obamacare is a disaster,&rdquo; and stimulated economic anxiety and fear through expressions such as &ldquo;CRUSH our economy.&rdquo; As Scheufele (2006) argued, Trump used the framing strategy to blame all the nation&rsquo;s problems on Hillary, induce public anger, and negatively affect public opinion about her, and presented himself as the solution by tweeting &ldquo;we will create 25 million jobs,&rdquo; &ldquo;Law, order &amp; safety.&rdquo; In other words, according to Borah's (2011) framing theory, the United States defines the problem of corruption and insecurity and attributes it to Hillary's incompetence and the failures of the previous administration. He creates fear and anxiety by tweeting that Hillary is not protecting the American people and then claims he can manage it. Trump&rsquo;s framing strategy supports RQ2, which states that Trump promoted political polarization through criticism and anger of voters toward the opposing camp through negative messages on Twitter based on the outsider identity created above based on a specific aggressive framing. This strategy worked as a political persuasion method that influenced voters' perception and judgment through emotional stimulation rather than a simple message delivery. In addition, this analysis has the limitation of focusing on Trump's Twitter strategy and not providing actual polarization result trends. According to data from the Pew Research Center (2016), 55% of Republican-leaning independent voters view the Democratic Party negatively, and only 30% cite the positive effects of Republican policies. These results support RQ2, which suggests that Trump's Twitter framing strategy based on framing theory promoted antipathy toward Hillary Clinton and caused voters to choose the opposing party based on their anger toward the opposing camp, ultimately pursuing a strategy aimed at political polarization.</p>\n<p>The results of the analysis for RQ3 confirmed that Trump&rsquo;s populist message presents the Us vs. Them structure, defining the existing political elites and the Democratic Party as the &ldquo;established group,&rdquo; and strengthening group solidarity by defining himself and his supporters as the American people, thereby leading voters to participate in politics. Tweets such as &ldquo;MAGA,&rdquo; &ldquo;#DrainTheSwamp,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am your voice,&rdquo; and &ldquo;We are going to take our country BACK!&rdquo; provide the concepts of &ldquo;the people&rdquo; and &ldquo;elites,&rdquo; which are the core components of populism argued by Brubaker (2017). Trump positioned himself as the public's spokesman and stoked public anger by framing Hillary as the enemy, using anti-establishment, patriotic, \"#PayToPlay\" tweets to portray Hillary as an \"elite\" and an outsider separate from the public. In addition, he used the &ldquo;get out and vote!&rdquo; political mobilization tweet to induce political participation rather than simply induce support. Wallace's (2016) article suggests that voter turnout increased in 2016 compared to 2012, which provides results for RQ3, a populist-based political mobilization strategy. This analysis complements the limitation of Groshek &amp; Koc-Michalska's (2017) claim that \"the more active users of social media, the less likely they are to support Trump as a candidate,\" and provides analysis that encourages political participation even among passive users.</p>\n<p>This analysis demonstrates that digital platforms can exert enormous influence on contemporary political society Twitter is not just a simple social media platform, but it provides an example of a strategy that functions as a digital space for politicians to form political identities, build frames, and mobilize voters. This confirms that Twitter functions as a &ldquo;media political space,&rdquo; and emphasizes the need for new research in existing political communication studies. Unlike Francia (2017), who treated Twitter as a simple medium or a promotional tool, this research analysed the strategies through which political identity, polarization, and voter mobilization formed through Twitter were delivered to voters through the process, purpose, method, expression, and strategy. This shows that Twitter was used in election campaigns as an important tool with political influence, not just a simple promotional tool.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5 CONCLUSION<br />The analysis revealed how three phenomena, namely, political identity construction, mass mobilization, and political polarization, were organically connected in a single media strategy through Donald Trump&rsquo;s Twitter strategy in the 2016 presidential election. Trump used Twitter in a media ecological manner to establish his identity as an &lsquo;outsider&rsquo; separated from the existing political order, and systematically criticized the existing media, making Twitter a major source of information and an alternative media space. This identity, combined with an aggressive framing strategy, stimulated the anger and anxiety of voters, promoted political polarization, and further expanded to mobilize supporters to actual political participation through populist messages. The results of this research are based on a single case study analysing Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Therefore, the generalization of the results of this study is limited. In addition, the research data is limited to 50 tweets and content-oriented analysis based on qualitative content analysis, so the accuracy of the results is limited. Since quantitative research methods (e.g., number of retweets, number of likes) were not used as analytical tools, there is a limitation in that it is not possible to numerically determine how much his Twitter strategy was delivered to the public. In addition, in-depth interview data needs to be supplemented to understand how voters accept messages of criticism or aggressive framing. In future studies, it is necessary to compare and investigate SNS strategies through various political cases and to study platform-based political discourse formation in detail. It is necessary to compare how the three elements derived from this study are carried out differently on other platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. It is necessary to investigate what changes the differences across platforms bring to users. To explore deeper into Trump&rsquo;s Twitter strategy, various factors should be taken into consideration. Thus, future research could contribute to exploring the political effects of Twitter-based strategies from various perspectives by combining quantitative methods such as surveys and collecting multiple tweets that show users&rsquo; reactions.</p>\n<p>Theoretical frameworks of media ecology, framing theory, and populism theory. This research examined the process and way Twitter (X) interacts with elements of identity, emotion, and discourse in modern politics. Therefore, the analysis was not limited to a technologically deterministic view of Twitter but was conducted based on an integrated perspective that understands how digital platforms function and what impact they have on the political sphere. Trump's Twitter strategy demonstrates that Twitter is not just a tool for disseminating information but also plays an important political role in modern political society as a tool for building political identity and mobilizing the public. The negative consequences of these Twitter strategies could pose a risk to political stability. This research explored the process and characteristics of how Trump's Twitter strategy formed political identity, caused political polarization among voters, and ultimately mobilized the public. Future research needs to more precisely explore the direction and structure of the interaction between these three outcomes. Today, digital platforms serve as an ecosystem for political strategies to produce political outcomes and therefore require appropriate and responsible use. The 2016 Trump incident provides an important foundation for understanding the relationship between Twitter (X) and digital political communication. It shows how Twitter functions politically in the new digital environment. Therefore, future research is needed to complement the limitations of this study and conduct more extensive and detailed research.</p>",

A detailed research background has been mentioned here with platforms including Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, and many others responsible for promoting unrealistic beauty standards, resulting in body discontent. A research rationale has therefore been interpreted here with present knowledge gap, followed by suggesting possible counterclaims, new questions, and approach of adding knowledge with continuation of existing traditions. Review of existing literatures highlighted the impact of correlated factors including socio-cultural aspects, gender, ethnic aspects along with &ldquo;perception of beauty and ideals of appearance&rdquo; on &ldquo;body image portrayal&rdquo; through &ldquo;social media platforms&rdquo;. Eating disorders (EDs), changes in behavioral patterns, signs of depression and anxiety along with low- self-esteem are significant challenges and negative implications young adults face when exposed to unrealistic body image on social media (SOCIAL MEDIA). Reducing Social media usage, engaging with positive content along with attaining peer-to-peer support can be beneficial for the young adults to address such misconceptions. Primary qualitative data has been collected from a sample size of 15 young adults through an online survey. The participants were identified and contacted on social media using the purposive sampling technique. Data collected from the survey has been analysed through regression and correlation analysis to arrive at nuanced inferences. The research evaluates the effect of the social media portrayals of the &ldquo;idealized body images&rdquo; on the self-esteem alongside the body satisfaction within the young adults. It evaluates the &ldquo;gender differences&rdquo;, &ldquo;peer pressure&rdquo;, alongside the potential for the &ldquo;social media platforms&rdquo; for regulating content in mitigating negative impacts. The process of body image portrayal in Social media promotion addresses the celebrity endorsements and others in influencing the market. Addressing the customers issues and causes of dissatisfaction through social media promotion gains concepts about the unrealistic beauty standards and benefits. This research has summarised the compulsive behaviour, such as mental disturbance like anxiety, depression and other physical issues in structuring the Social media promotional process. Recommended strategies on highlighting the diversity and influence of digital content have been addressed in this research. <br /><br /></p>\n<p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p>1.1 Research background<br />The current digital age has been responsible for social media being an influential force to shape body image perceptions, especially among younger adults. Use of social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, and many others) are suggested here for having a worldwide acceptance, further exposing users to highly curated and often unrealistic portrayals of beauty. However, recent studies have proved these idealised images contributing to body discontent and low self-esteem, thus inculcating frequent comparison with others. The primary concerns of people with borderline personality disorder were hair and skin disfigurements, and social media platforms have suggested its cruciality in frequently exacerbating negative body image (Krzymowski, 2024). Therefore, this societal pressure can be linked with unattainable beauty standards, leading to negative psychological effects like anxiety, depression, and eating disorders as well.<br />A detailed understanding of self-perception can be developed among young individuals through increased social media usage, further seeking abstract validation through liking, sharing, and commenting. However, studies show that excessive social media usage can link to decreased levels of body satisfaction, self-objectification, as well as more and frequent body surveillance. As per Tandon et al. (2021), psychological states and social phenomenon being linked with social media users are mostly identified by the frequency of statuses and posts coming from an individual. Furthermore, examining the psychological effects of young people&rsquo;s social media exposure is essential, especially in light of the growing concerns about body satisfaction. The aim of the following study has therefore been recognised with social media platforms in projecting body image approaches and its impact on cultural satisfaction among young adults.<br />1.2 Research rationale<br />Social media portrayals of body images have made a significant impact on issues like decreased self-esteem and physical dissatisfaction faced by young people. These platforms are also responsible for creating a culture promoting unattainable beauty standards, further increasing mental perception issues and worries about one's own image. According to one 2022 survey, more than 46% of young adults aged between 18 and 24 have suffered from body image issues linked with negative wellbeing experiences (Statista, 2023). Additionally, the same survey has<br /> <br />identified 41% of respondents (aged 25 to 34) experiencing adversities on personal wellbeing due to unrealistic body images. Manipulation and filtering of photos are also becoming so common nowadays, and these can further perpetuate unachievable beauty standards for young individuals being exposed to self-doubt, social or cultural comparison. A broader implication of mental health, especially within the young adults has been thoroughly interpreted with clarifying the broader implications of digital media, making social media platforms a part herein.<br /> <br />Figure 1.2.1: Global percentage of individuals by age group indicating body image to have a detrimental impact on the wellbeing in 2022<br />(Source: Statista, 2023)<br />Young adults with self-doubt are also beginning to blame social media platforms for peer comparison and self-validation issues as main challenges. A repeated exposure to these unrealistic body images is therefore linked with rapid increase of eating disorders and low self- esteem within young individuals. Despite social media's capacity to connect, its detrimental impacts on young adults' negative perception around body image underscore the urgent need for a coordinated effort to lessen negative impacts (Merino et al., 2024). However, the research has stated a significant knowledge gap on the underlying cultural mechanisms, especially to interpret the proof of positive correlation between social media usage and negative body perception.<br /> <br />Additionally, different types of body image portrayals through social media platforms are often recognised as a significant knowledge gap, as it has the potential to affect the young adults in different ways. This includes influencer content, peer comparisons, and digital advertising possibilities, making it a critical aspect to imply here. Furthermore, the research can state the possibility of varying engagement with different social media platforms to influence self- perception differently, making it possible to emphasise algorithm-driven exposure around idealised body images.<br />An identification of specific factors can therefore be recognised as specific factors based on self- esteem issues to identify, thereby making it possible to explore potential coping mechanisms for young adults. As opined by Al-Musharaf et al. (2022), an indirect role of self-esteem can be thoroughly associated for young adults to manage the anxiety issues, thus acknowledging body dissatisfaction challenges to be reduced. A counter-claiming of established knowledge has been avoided here, rather this study has shown its criticality to expand contemporary media trends and its evolving impact on cultural perception of young people. Moreover, cultural and gender- specific aspects can also be demonstrated here using the particular research perspective, thus quantifying young adults' responses to be acknowledged with body image portrayals online. New questions can therefore be raised in relation with the function of self-awareness and digital literacy in reducing adverse impacts of social media portrayal of body images. An addition to the continuing conversation around &lsquo;psychological effects of social media&rsquo; can be thoroughly developed on earlier studies by offering fresh perspectives. All these aspects have collectively become ideal in providing the valuable knowledge towards adversity of digital and social media, especially to healthcare professionals, educators, and policymakers. Furthermore, the research findings here can possibly help in demonstrating more effective strategies to support young adults for healthier body satisfaction and positive measures of self-esteem to develop in an increasingly digital world.<br />1.3 Significance of the research<br />The psychological effects of social media platforms in order to depict individual bodily perception can be thoroughly emphasised by mental imagery of younger adults to be collectively acknowledged in this study. Social media frequently promotes unattainable beauty standards, further influencing users' opinions negatively with growing consumption of digital information. Addressing mental health issues including anxiety over bodily perception, followed by<br /> <br />decreasing self-esteem requires an understanding of its influence. However, Digennaro and Tescione (2024) stated that these body images are often curated with idealised yet unattainable beauty standards, making these perceptions too mainstream and affecting the younger audience. A thorough explanation regarding external validation and the psychological impact of cultural engagement metrics such as likes and comments is necessary to develop the research with adequate details. Therefore, resolving this issue has become essential to interpret the wider effects of digital media in detail based on mental health.<br />1.4 Structure of dissertation</p>\n<p>Figure 1.4.1: Dissertation Structure<br />(Source: Self-developed)</p>\n<p>2. LITERATURE REVIEW</p>\n<p>2.1 Chapter Introduction</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Body image portrayal&rdquo; on Social media platforms refers to the trends of demonstrating social images that encourage people to perceive their own bodies by following &ldquo;unrealistic beauty standards&rdquo; and social comparison. &ldquo;Portrayal of body image&rdquo; via Social media platforms can cause negative impact on the audience, especially young adults, by raising concerns related to mental health issues, body dissatisfaction and &lsquo;low self-esteem&rsquo; (Fioravanti et al., 2022). This chapter focuses on evaluating existing studies for assessing the impact of social media &ldquo;body image portrayal&rdquo; on young adults by considering consumption, audience reception and media content.<br />2.2 Concept of body image portrayal on Social media platforms</p>\n<p>Body image can be elucidated as &ldquo;one&rsquo;s perception&rdquo;, &ldquo;thoughts&rdquo;, and &ldquo;emotions&rdquo; reading their own body that is a reflection of the social constructs and the societal culture and norms. Jiotsa et al. (2021) in their study mentions that for the last 30 years, the media has played an instrumental role in overexposing people to over-exposing people to unrealistic &ldquo;body image&rdquo; ideals such as &ldquo;thinness&rdquo;, establishing these ideals as new reference standards. The glorification of &ldquo;idealised body images&rdquo; can exacerbate the feelings of dissatisfaction of one's own body, especially in young adults. These unrealistic portrayals of &ldquo;the perfect body&rdquo; can lead to psychological consequences in young adults such as &ldquo;decreased self-esteem&rdquo; and &ldquo;confidence&rdquo;. Exposure to &ldquo;idealized body representations&rdquo; on social media contributes to &ldquo;unfavourable body evaluations&rdquo; and the willingness of young adults to attain such &ldquo;unrealistic standards&rdquo; (Khatri, 2024). The extensive use of social media is found to be profoundly affecting the formation of &ldquo;idealized body images&rdquo; especially within adolescent girls and boys. Constant comparison to &ldquo;celebrities and influencers&rdquo; contributes to &ldquo;body image concerns&rdquo; impacting both genders. The propagation of the &ldquo;thin-ideal image&rdquo; over the years on social media has led to instances of adolescents suffering from &ldquo;eating disorders (EDs)&rdquo; to attain such a feat. Hence, the evolving unrealistic presentation of body image on social media has led to increased uncertainty and dissatisfaction of young adults regarding their own bodies leading to health and psychological short-term and long-term repercussions.<br /> <br />2.3 Discussion on the ways through which social media portrays body image and assessing relevant factors<br />Application of filters along with photo editing tools and using &ldquo;unrealistic beauty standards&rdquo; are the major ways associated with the portrayal of body image on social media (SM) that adversely influence mental health of young adults. Social media can encourage young people to compare their own bodies with others to meet specific beauty standards, resulting in &ldquo;toxic culture of comparison&rdquo; along with competition within online platforms (Young et al., 2022). Referring to this, the main purpose of body image portrayal through social media platforms is to promote &lsquo;unrealistic beauty standards&rsquo; cultivate a &lsquo;toxic culture&rsquo; and encourage comparison about body and beauty among young people. Moreover, several people are likely to post only the best photos on social media platforms that may not be the exact representation of their everyday appearance. On the other hand, Social media platforms mainly feature photos of people having perfect bodies as well as faces by applying &lsquo;photo editing tools&rsquo; along with filters for improving appearance (Conwill et al., 2024). Considering this, comparing own bodies with unrealistic standards of beauty can be depressing for young adults, resulting in poor confidence level and low self- esteem leading to long-term health and psychological implications.<br />Body dissatisfaction is mainly associated with negative feelings along with thoughts of an individual regarding their own body that incorporate negative evaluation of weight, body shape and size (Gruszka et al., 2022). Growing body dissatisfaction concerns due to &lsquo;unrealistic beauty standards&rsquo; on social media can raise mental health issues such as depression and anxiety among young adults. As a complicated phenomenon, gender, socio-cultural along with ethnic factors majorly influenced the body image portrayal via social media platforms. Several internal factors related to the body image portrayal are &ldquo;perception of beauty&rdquo;, &ldquo;ideals of appearance&rdquo; conveyed by media and society along with attitude towards oneself and others (Tort-Nasarre et al., 2023). Similarly, gender differences as well as perspectives, marital status and education level can also be considered as some crucial external factors that influence the social media body image portrayal.<br />2.4 Evaluating the consumption and interactions of young adults with the cultural products including social media body image portrayal<br /> <br />&lsquo;Photo-based platforms&rsquo; can be considered as worse for body image portrayal as these significantly concentrate on &lsquo;physical appearance&rsquo; and encourage young adults to view &ldquo;appearance-focused content&rdquo;. The research of Vandenbosch et al. (2022) identified that women spending time on Instagram referring to a lab setting have been found to involve greater &lsquo;appearance comparison&rsquo; compared to women spending time on Facebook. Considering this, using Instagram as a Social media platform has been found to be positively associated with &lsquo;appearance comparison&rsquo; along with &lsquo;self-objectification&rsquo;, indicating the high consumption and interaction of young adults regarding body image portrayal. Young adults having a high tendency to consume as well as interact with media portraying ideal body image are more likely to encounter &lsquo;poor self-worth&rsquo; along with &lsquo;body dissatisfaction&rsquo; (Hussain &amp; Shahid, 2024). Consuming unrealistic Social media body image portrayal as cultural products can lead to unhealthy behaviours such as self-harm along with eating disorders after seeing images with &lsquo;unrealistic body standards&rsquo;. Inversely, a recent APA (American Psychological Association) study has revealed that young adults and teens who decreased Social media consumption by almost 50% observed necessary improvement about their feelings regarding physical appearance (French, 2024). This indicates the positive image of lowering Social media usage along with interactions for younger people to consume body image portrayal as cultural products less and positively improve mental health.<br />Contrarily, demonstration of &lsquo;fitspiration images&rsquo; indicating photos of people while exercising or wearing exercise outfits can raise the concern of &ldquo;body image dissatisfaction&rdquo; by portraying only toned and thin models (Fioravanti et al., 2022). Although consuming &lsquo;fitspiration images&rsquo; can positively influence community building and motivate young adults to maintain a healthy lifestyle, this can also lead to social comparison and cause &lsquo;feelings of inadequacy&rsquo; among younger demographics. High interaction with &ldquo;body image portrayal&rdquo; through Social media platforms can promote inadequacy by cultivating a &lsquo;culture of comparison&rsquo; and cause negative impact on self-worth of younger people (Xiong, 2023). Constant comparison with &lsquo;unrealistic beauty standards&rsquo; along with praising &ldquo;digital enhanced photos&rdquo; as ideal body types can negatively influence media interaction and cultural consumption regarding &lsquo;body image portrayal&rsquo;.<br /> <br />2.5 Analysis of the impact of social media body image portrayal on audience reception, media content and consumption<br />Application of &lsquo;photo-based platforms&rsquo; including Snapchat along with Instagram has found to be consistently related to &ldquo;dysfunctional body image&rdquo; as compared to &ldquo;text-based platforms&rdquo; including Twitter and Facebook (Vandenbosch et al., 2022). Referring to audience reception, &lsquo;exposure to Instagram images&rsquo; has been found to cause negative impact on &ldquo;women&rsquo;s body image&rdquo; considering the detrimental impact of celebrity images on young adults&rsquo; body images. &ldquo;Exposure to body images&rdquo; can reduce body appreciation, increase the concern of body dissatisfaction and lead to &ldquo;trait appearance comparison&rdquo; greatly as compared to travel images (Brown &amp; Tiggemann, 2020). In this regard, revealing unrealistic body images on social media platforms by using editing tools indicates the misleading application of media content, leading to low self-esteem and high body dissatisfaction rate. On the contrary, as of 2022, a study based on &ldquo;TikTok and diet culture&rdquo; revealed that consuming TikTok content can promote eating disorder habits among audiences by demonstrating &ldquo;thinner body types&rdquo; (Ferguson, 2024). Regarding consumption, body image portrayal on social media platforms can cause &lsquo;idealising dangerous habits&rsquo;, leading to &lsquo;low-self-image&rsquo; among young adults and preying on audiences&rsquo; insecurities regarding their body types. Hence, over prioritising body image portrayal on social media platforms can adversely influence media content, audience reception along with consumption, leading to dangerous eating habits and promoting &lsquo;low-self-image&rsquo; among younger adults.<br />2.6 Challenges faced by young adults due to misleading portrayal of body image on Social media</p>\n<p>Some prominent challenges that young adults face due to exposure to unrealistic body imagery on Social media platforms are in the form of &ldquo;eating disorders&rdquo;, &ldquo;low self-esteem&rdquo;, &ldquo;depression and anxiety&rdquo; along with &ldquo;social withdrawals&rdquo;. Some long-term repercussions of elongated exposure to such content can lead to young adults facing &ldquo;substantial challenges in building healthy relationships&rdquo; and facing &ldquo;mental health difficulties&rdquo;. Jiotsa et al. (2021) had utilised the &ldquo;Eating Disorder Inventory Scale&rdquo; to infer that widespread use of social media can increase the rate of &ldquo;body dissatisfaction&rdquo; among teenagers and young adults as well as their drive for thinness, rendering themselves more vulnerable to eating disorders. Conversely, Castellanos Silva &amp; Steins (2023) ascertained that overexposure to &ldquo;body-imagery Social media content&rdquo; can lead to body dissatisfaction ultimately resulting in psychopathologies such as depression.<br /> <br />Moreover &ldquo;anxiety disorders&rdquo; along with &ldquo;body dysmorphic disorder&rdquo; are common phenomena that can be noticed in children exposed to body imagery content on Social media. Alongside, a major challenge faced by young adults is through an increased urge to undertake &ldquo;harmful appearance modification&rdquo; such as &ldquo;aesthetic surgery&rdquo;, &ldquo;excessive exercise&rdquo;, or &ldquo;use of laxatives or steroids&rdquo; that can further deteriorate their health.<br />Moreover, a major challenge that young adults encounter is the &ldquo;deterioration in behavioural aspects&rdquo; where inability to match the body imagery on Social media can lead to the lower willingness to self-examine for cancer prevention. Castellanos Silva &amp; Steins, (2023) highlights traits such as high rates of smoking and reduction in the quality of life and &ldquo;sexual dysfunction&rdquo; is also noticed. The repercussion of these can lead to young adults finding it difficult to form healthy organic relationships in their life. Conversely, Rosenthal &amp; Tobin (2023) have found that comparing themselves with others online in appearances and lifestyle has a negative effect on the self-esteem and self-perceptions of young adults. This can also reduce confidence of young adults in approaching new challenges in life and have a positive outlook towards it hindering their socio-cognitive capabilities. Hence, it is essential that effective use of reprimanding strategies be implemented so that young adults can be less exposed to the vulnerabilities of body imagery on Social media.<br />2.7 Recommending strategies for young adults to resolve the identified challenges related to misleading body imagery on Social Media<br />It is ubiquitously believed that the more time spent on social media by an individual, the less &ldquo;protective self-esteem&rdquo; the individual inculcates towards depressive symptoms. Regarding this, Rosenthal &amp; Tobin (2023) suggests that &ldquo;reducing Social media usage&rdquo;, &ldquo;intentional engagement with positive content&rdquo; along with leveraging &ldquo;peer-to-peer social support&rdquo; can be helpful in creating a sense of belonging among young adults. Paradoxically, the authors state that the way in which individuals interact with social media can be a better determining factor than the period of usage. Young adult users of social media can expose themselves to positive and uplifting content that can improve their &ldquo;self-esteem&rdquo; and &ldquo;mental health&rdquo; (Vandenbosch et al., 2022). Alongside this, &ldquo;fostering real relationships with others&rdquo; through participation in &ldquo;peer- support groups&rdquo; can significantly inculcate positivity among young adults affected by the drive to attain an unrealistic body-imagery.<br /> <br />Conversely, Thai et al. (2024) stresses on &ldquo;regulating Social media usage (SMU)&rdquo; stating that minimising the use of social media can lead to &ldquo;discernible improvements&rdquo; in both &ldquo;appearance and weight esteem&rdquo;. This addresses the major challenges of the health disorders such as EDs that young adults face while trying to attain the body image as portrayed on Social media. Conversely, Jiotsa et al. (2021) indicates the use of &ldquo;awareness programs&rdquo; through deconstructing the &ldquo;ideal body&rdquo; myth can be effective in inculcating the sensation of positive body imagery on young adults. Informing or educating young adults that their role models&rsquo; BMI is not representative of the general masses along with providing examples of defying stories can be beneficial for changing the perception levels among young adults. Teaching young adults to consider photographs of &ldquo;plus-size&rdquo; and &ldquo;zero-size&rdquo; models in the context of &ldquo;bodily-diversity&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;bodily-ideals&rdquo; can have a positive effect on aspects of &ldquo;psychological-well-being&rdquo; of individuals (Vandenbosch et al., 2022). Hence, it is essential that stern and effective remedies such as the aforementioned strategies be taken to prevent long-term consequences of exposure to unrealistic body imagery on Social media.<br />2.8 Theoretical Perspective</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Tripartite Influence Model&rdquo;</p>\n<p><br />Figure 2.8.1: &ldquo;Tripartite Influence Model&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Source: Redeveloped from Hanan et al., 2023)</p>\n<p>The above figure indicates the key elements associated with the &ldquo;Tripartite Influence Model&rdquo; (TIM) that include socio-cultural factors such as family, media and peers, &lsquo;appearance comparison&rsquo; and &lsquo;body dissatisfaction&rsquo;, leading to &lsquo;restrained eating and bulimia. The &ldquo;Tripartite<br /> <br />Influence Model&rdquo; evaluates parents, media and peers as the three &ldquo;core sources of influence&rdquo; that develop body image concern along with eating disturbances (Hanan et al., 2023). Application of the &ldquo;Tripartite Influence Model&rdquo; can be helpful for evaluating body image concern along with eating disorder issues among young adults by understanding the contribution of appearance pressure from family and media. A study of &ldquo;Center for Digital Thriving&rdquo; revealed that almost 51% teens have felt pressure to look their best and present in an ideal way (Common Sense Media, 2024). Referring to this, implication of the TIM model can be favourable for assessing the influence portraying body image on social media platforms on young adults.<br />&ldquo;Social Comparison Theory&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Figure 2.8.2: &ldquo;Social Comparison Theory&rdquo;</p>\n<p>(Source: Inspired by Haidong, 2024)<br /> <br />The above figure demonstrates the main factors associated with &ldquo;Social Comparison Theory&rdquo; that highlights the positive and negative effects of social comparison experienced by individuals. As a theoretical framework, &ldquo;Social Comparison Theory&rdquo; mainly suggests that individuals value their social and personal worth after comparing themselves to others to determine positive and negative sides (Haidong, 2024). Almost 8 out of 10 teens acknowledged the negative impact of social media to a certain extent that can raise appearance pressure (Common Sense Media, 2024). Implication of &ldquo;Social Comparison Theory&rdquo; can be impactful for evaluating the mindset of young adults for understanding the influence of &ldquo;body image portrayal&rdquo; on social media platforms and developing strategies for self-evaluation and motivation.<br />2.9 Literature Gap</p>\n<p>The research of Fioravanti et al. (2022) highlighted the gap in existing studies regarding the image types that audiences view on a regular basis on &ldquo;social networking sites&rdquo; that adversely impact body image portrayal. The current study focuses on assessing the type of images to identify the image type that majorly affects the &ldquo;body image portrayal&rdquo; on Social media platforms. Furthermore, the current study also focuses on assessing challenges encountered by young adults due to misleading and unrealistic &ldquo;body image portrayal&rdquo; on social media platforms.<br />2.10 Conceptual framework</p>\n<p>Figure 2.10.1: Conceptual framework<br /> <br />(Source: Self-evaluated)</p>\n<p>The above diagram of conceptual framework highlights the correlated factors, impact, challenges and strategies for young adults related to &ldquo;body image portrayal&rdquo; on social media platforms.<br />2.11 Chapter Summary</p>\n<p>Factors such as ethnic, socio-cultural aspects, &ldquo;perception of beauty&rdquo;, gender and &ldquo;ideals of appearance&rdquo; majorly influence interactions and consumption of &ldquo;body image portrayal&rdquo; on social media by young adults. Referring to impact, &ldquo;body image portrayal&rdquo; on social media can lead to &ldquo;poor self-worth&rdquo;, body dissatisfaction and appearance comparison and self-objectification tendency among young adults. Challenges such as diminishing self-esteem, signs of depression and anxiety and instances of social withdrawals and inability to form real human relations are faced by young adults exposed to social media body-imagery. Contextually, reducing social media usage, consuming positive content, participating in awareness programs along with embracing the concept of bodily diversity can be beneficial.</p>\n<p>3. RESEARCH QUESTIONS, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</p>\n<p>3.1 Research Aim</p>\n<p>Aim of the current study is to investigate the impact of &ldquo;social media body image portrays&rdquo; by analysing consumption and interaction of young adults with these cultural products.<br />3.2 Research Objectives</p>\n<p>&bull; To evaluate ways and relevant factors associated with &ldquo;body image portrayal&rdquo; on social media (social media) platforms<br />&bull; To assess the impact of consumption and interactions of young adults regarding &ldquo;social media body image portrayal&rdquo; as a cultural product<br />&bull; To investigate challenges encountered by young adults considering misleading body image portrayal on social media platforms<br />&bull; To explore strategies for saving young adults from misconception related to unrealistic beauty standards on Social media sites causing low-self-esteem and body dissatisfaction among them<br />3.3 Research Questions</p>\n<p>Q1: What are the relevant ways and factors associated with &ldquo;body image portrayal&rdquo; on social media platforms?<br />Q2: What are the impacts and intricacies of young adults&rsquo; interaction and consumption of cultural products such as &ldquo;Social media body image portrayal&rdquo;?<br />Q3: What are the significant challenges that young adults face when exposed to misleading &ldquo;body image portrayal&rdquo; on Social media?<br />Q4: What are some ways to address the misconception in young adults related to unrealistic beauty standards on Social media sites causing low-self-esteem and body dissatisfaction?</p>\n<p>4. METHODOLOGY</p>\n<p>4.1 Chapter Introduction</p>\n<p>Research Methodology can be elucidated as a systematic plan for collecting, analysing and interpretation of information in relation to the predetermined objectives and questions of the study (Taherdoost, 2022). Subsequently, the Methodology Chapter discusses in detail the methodological choices made in study along with the justification for the choices. Vital aspects such as research strategy, data collection procedures, sampling techniques and analysis procedures along with the inclusion exclusion criteria for the determined sources have been provided further in the chapter. The methodology chapter had been developed through following the Research Onion layers while tying with the previous chapter (Literature Review) by introducing methodological choices made in for deducing findings<br />4.2 Research Onion</p>\n<p><br />Figure 4.2.1: &lsquo;Saunders' Research Onion&rsquo;</p>\n<p>(Source: Influenced by Saunders &amp; Bristow, 2023)</p>\n<p>The above figure represents &ldquo;Saunders&rsquo; Research Onion&rdquo; that enables researchers in organising their ideas and making crucial decisions while developing the research methodology (Saunders &amp; Bristow, 2023). Contextually, this study has utilised the &lsquo;Research Onion&rsquo; a reference point to structure the proceeding of methodological choices being made. Alongside, each aspect of the methodology chapter has been represented in a sequential manner as depicted by the layers of the &ldquo;Research Onion&rdquo; to provide clarity and adhere to research norms that are widely accepted and practiced.<br />4.3 Research Philosophy</p>\n<p>Research Philosophy is a set of beliefs and values that guides a researcher during the process of data collection and his approach towards a study. Contextually, the current study has been based<br /> <br />on the &lsquo;Positivism Paradigm&rsquo; for collecting information regarding body image portrayal on social media and perception of young adults towards such &ldquo;cultural products&rdquo;. Positivism takes a &ldquo;realist ontological stance&rdquo; believing that reality is objective in nature and independent of &ldquo;human perception&rdquo; (Maksimovic and Evtimov, 2023). Further, &lsquo;positivist researchers&rsquo; favour the quantitative methods such as surveys, experiments and statistical analysis as positivism philosophy states that &lsquo;reality&rsquo; can be effectively understood through numbers and observable facts. A positivism philosophy can be essential in establishing significant linkages between variables such as &lsquo;unrealistic body image&rsquo; and &lsquo;low self-esteem in young adults&rsquo; to attain nuanced inferences and conclusive findings. Conversely, other philosophical choices such as Interpretivism have been avoided in the study due to the &lsquo;subjective nature&rsquo; of the approach. Interpretivism is more suited for qualitative-based studies. Alongside, Interpretivism suffers from the drawbacks of generating room for bias on behalf of the researcher along with lack of quantitative support to the claims being made in the study (BRM, 2024). Hence, to avoid the pitfalls of interpretivism, the positivism philosophy has been used due to its better suitability to the current study.<br />4.4 Research Approach</p>\n<p>Research Approach can be determined as the outlined plan and techniques used for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting the data in a study. The &ldquo;Deductive Approach&rdquo; has been in the current study for analysing the impact that &lsquo;cultural products&rsquo; like &lsquo;body image&rsquo; on social media platforms have on young adults. A deductive approach is beneficial for establishing &lsquo;causal relationships&rsquo; between concepts and variables, allowing concepts to be measured quantitatively (BRM, 2022). Moreover, the deductive approach is helpful in generalising research findings that can serve as groundwork for future studies and understand &ldquo;cause-effect&rdquo; kind of relation in research variables. A deductive approach can be beneficial in the context of the current study in leveraging statistical inferences to establish causal relation between key variables such as &ldquo;positive content&rdquo; and &ldquo;emotional well-being among young adults&rdquo;. Conversely, methods such as an &lsquo;inductive approach&rsquo; have been avoided from the current study for being time-consuming in nature along with potential for inaccurate conclusions due to limited data support (Susanto et al., 2024). In addition, inductive studies are usually vulnerable to &lsquo;researcher biases, difficulties in testing hypotheses and objectives along with potential for inaccurate generalisations. Thereby,<br /> <br />to avoid the potential for misappropriation of the conclusions of the study, the deductive approach has been determined as the most suitable technique for making nuanced inferences of research findings.<br />4.5 Research Design</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Research Design&rsquo; is a plan that outlines the procedures of data collection that needs to be taken for answering the research questions. Regarding this, the current research takes a &lsquo;Descriptive Design&rsquo; for structuring the data collection procedure for a quantitative approach. &lsquo;Descriptive design&rsquo; allows for a more &ldquo;budget-friendly approach&rdquo; for the study of a phenomenon facilitating a &lsquo;holistic understanding&rsquo; (Hall et al., 2023). Moreover, descriptive studies are suited for quantitative and qualitative approaches that allow for various forms of data collection such as &lsquo;surveys&rsquo;, &lsquo;focus groups&rsquo;, and &lsquo;case studies&rsquo;. Conversely, research approaches such as &lsquo;exploratory design&rsquo; have been avoided due to scope of &lsquo;limited generalisability&rsquo; along with the potential for &lsquo;bias creep&rsquo;. Moreover, the lack of &lsquo;statistical validity&rsquo; along with being &lsquo;time- consuming&rsquo; in nature forms the major drawbacks of exploratory studies (Olawale et al., 2023). Hence, the current study follows the descriptive research design due to its better suitability to the other methodological choices being made.<br />4.6 Research Strategy</p>\n<p>Research strategy can be determined as the outlined plan that aids in achieving the predetermined research goals and objectives of the study. Contextually, the current study will be collecting &ldquo;Primary Quantitative&rdquo; data through a survey on young adults and their interplay with Social media body image portrayal. Primary quantitative data is essential for measuring the way in which individuals behave in natural settings, along with the ability to track changes over time through precise numerical measurements (Mazhar et al., 2021). The use of the qualitative data can be essential in establishing interlinks between the variables such as &ldquo;body imagery&rdquo; and &ldquo;self-esteem of young adults&rdquo; in the current study. Conversely, the use of secondary data has been avoided due to chances of garnering irrelevant information, not in alignment to the study objectives. Moreover, secondary data suffers from possessing &lsquo;data inaccuracy&rsquo; and limited capabilities in answering specific research objectives due to existing gaps in knowledge<br /> <br />(Taherdoost, 2021). For the purpose of avoiding inaccurate and dispersed inferences, only primary data of quantitative nature has been used in the study.<br />4.7 Data Collection Procedure</p>\n<p>Primary quantitative data pertaining to body imagery on social media and its influence on the self-esteem and well-being of young adults has been collected through a survey. The survey has taken place on an online platform using a Google Form questionnaire tool consisting of 12 close-ended questions. Surveys are determined as a viable process of data collection in a primary-based survey due to being cost-effective, allowing for large sample sizes, easy administration and allowing for maximum autonomy to the participants (Vergara-Hern&aacute;ndez, 2024). The participants of the survey have been identified on social media platforms, subsequent to which an invitation for the survey has been provided to them through a link to the questionnaire in a personal email. Conversely, the use of interviews has been avoided due to being time-consuming and resource-intensive in nature. Moreover, interviews have potential for social desirability, interviewer and interviewee bias along with challenges such as &lsquo;interviewer skills&rsquo; in establishing rapport through open-ended questions (H&ouml;ppner et al., 2022). Hence, for better inferences in terms of statistical output, data collection through a survey has been chosen over an interview in the current study.<br />4.8 Sampling Techniques</p>\n<p>Sampling can be elucidated as the &lsquo;selection of a subset&rsquo; from a larger population to identify a set of individuals favourable for the research study. Contextually, the &lsquo;non-probability purposive sampling&rsquo; technique has been used in the current study to obtain primary quantitative data from 15 young adults in the UK (aged 18-25 years). Purposive sampling enables selection of &lsquo;specific individuals&rsquo; relevant to the research questions, providing deep and conceptualised insights that are adaptable to the requirements of the study (Thomas, 2022). Since, the focus of the current research is specific to young adults that are aged 18-25 years; the selection of participants through purposive sampling is justified. Conversely, other sampling techniques such as stratified sampling have been avoided due to the time-consuming nature of the technique due to the process of sub-categorisation. Moreover, data derived from stratified sampling requires analysis of each strata group individually that has not been categorised into groups (Pettersson &amp;<br /> <br />Krumscheid, 2022). Hence, discarding the perils of stratifying participant groups and analysing strata groups separately, a purposive approach to selection of participants has been followed.<br />4.9 Data Analysis Procedure</p>\n<p>Data Analysis in research can be inferred as the procedure of analysing data to identify patterns, relationships, and trends in the existing dataset. The survey data collected has subsequently been analysed through statistical inferences, namely, correlation and regression analysis through Ms-Excel. Correlation Analysis is essential for revealing meaningful relationships between different or similar groups of metrics, providing insights regarding interdependencies between the variables of a phenomenon under study (Janse et al., 2021). Alongside, regression analysis can be effective in establishing causal relations between variables that can help researchers in making forecasts and predictions backed by statistical numbers. The causal effect of the variables in the current study can be more effectively explained through statistical data and hence justified the choice of the mentioned analysis techniques. Conversely, analysis procedures such as Thematic Analysis have been avoided due to its non-suitability to primary data analysis. Moreover, thematic analysis is subjectivity in nature along with being a time-consuming process especially in case of a larger dataset (Hecker, 2024). Hence, correlation and regression analysis has been performed on the survey data findings to ensure that nuanced conclusions can be derived that are supported by statistical evidence.<br />4.10 Inclusion Exclusion Criteria</p>\n<p>Inclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria<br />● Young adults (aged 18-25 years) have been included in the survey<br />● Individuals proficient in English have only been included for better communication purposes<br />● Individuals that have interacted with unrealistic body image portrayal on Social media affecting their well-being ● Individuals that are non-adults (below 25 years old) along with individuals&rsquo; obverse 25-year-old have not been included<br />● Individuals that are not affluent in English has been excluded<br />● Individuals that are not aware of body image portrayal on Social media<br /> <br />Table 4.10.1: Inclusion Exclusion Criteria</p>\n<p>(Source: Self-Determined)</p>\n<p>4.11 Research Time Horizon</p>\n<p>Figure 4.11.1: Research Timeline</p>\n<p>(Source: Self-Developed)</p>\n<p>The above figure represents the pictorial representation of the research timeline showcasing the time taken for each chapter of the study. The current study is based on a &lsquo;Cross-Sectional Time Horizon&rsquo; to mitigate the inherent time-constraint of the study. Cross-sectional studies are a quick and effective manner of collecting data at a given point of time to understand the causal relations among the variables in a study (Taris et al., 2021). Hence, to avoid the procedure of a longitudinal study, the current study has collected data in a cross-sectional timeline.<br />4.12 Ethical Consideration</p>\n<p>Research Ethics can be considered as the application of &lsquo;fundamental ethical principles&rsquo; to research activities that includes the design, implementation, respect towards society and regulation of research (Drolet et al., 2023). Contextually, during the conduction of the study, a consent form was assigned to the participants before initiating the survey. The participants were provided autonomy over their participation in the study with an option to withdraw anytime from the proceedings. The anonymity of the participants has been maintained by not naming them directly or representing sensitive personal information reading their identification. The &ldquo;Data Protection Act 2018&rdquo; explicitly states using personal information of individuals fairly, lawfully<br /> <br />and transparently with appropriate security (UK Government, 2024). The study has adhered to this by storing information of the participants in a password-protected OneDrive file with credentials known only to the researcher.<br />4.13 Chapter Summary</p>\n<p>The Methodology chapter has provided in detail the procedures followed and methodological choices that have been made in the study along with justification for each choice. The positivism philosophy along with deductive approach along with the descriptive research design has been helpful in ascertaining effective causal relations between the variables. Moreover, the purposive sampling has been beneficial in collecting primary qualitative data through a survey on 15 young adults within a cross-sectional timeline. Finally, the use of regression and correlation analysis has been beneficial in making nuanced inferences regarding the portrayal of body image on Social media and the effect of such cultural products on young adults.</p>\n<p>5. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION<br />5.1 Chapter introduction<br />The chapter discusses the research findings of the impact of social media body portrayals on the self-esteem and body satisfaction of young adults. It establishes that the enormous associations for the individuals are substantially more unimaginable than the less relations, it is an evaluation of the complex connection among the idealized body images available on stages like Instagram, and of the body image. The chapter aims at integrating the quantitative survey results and qualitatively interviewing insights to uncover the psychological effects of social media.<br />5.2 Findings</p>\n<p>Figure 5.2.1: Showing the age distribution<br />The particular bar chart above depicts the age distribution of the survey participants. It is found that the most respondents (23.5 among the sample) are aged 21. Other important age groups are 22 (15.7%) and 23 (19.6%). The youngest of the sample are young adults, aged 18, comprising<br />7.8%.</p>\n<p><br />Figure 5.2.2: Showing gender distribution<br />The particular pie chart indicates the distribution of gender within the survey participants. It is discovered that 72.5% of respondents are male and the number is 25.5%. The other gender categories are represented by a small percentage, 2%. The distribution of this indicates that the majority of the people surveyed within this study are male and it can serve a part in interpreting gender-based body image perceptions on social media.<br /> <br />Figure 5.2.3: Distribution of Social media Platforms Most Actively Used<br />The pie chart shows the distribution of social media platforms the participants that are utilized most. It was seen that 49% of respondents are most active on Facebook and 45.1 % on Instagram. Some of the participants remain engaged in X and with other platforms.<br /> <br />Figure 5.2.4: Frequency of the Exposure to Idealized Body Images on Social media<br /> <br />Through the pie chart, it has shown the frequency of exposure to idealized body images on social media. It is found that 47.1% of the participants see such images very often about 35.3% frequently. The data shows only 17.6 percent user almost never signified idealized body images social media has such an impact on young adults&rsquo; body image,<br /> <br />Figure 5.2.5: Perceived Impact of Social media on Body Satisfaction.<br />It can be seen within the pie chart how social media was perceived to affect body satisfaction. About 64.7% of the respondents have beliefs about the positive or negative impact of social media on their body satisfaction.<br /> <br />Figure 5.2.6: Perception of Body Image Portrayal on Social media as Negative.<br />The pie chart depicts the perception of social media body image portrayal as negative. It reveals that 51 percent strongly agree that body images are mostly negative and 41.2 percent moderately agree. Only 7.8 % are unsure about the negative portrayal.</p>\n<p><br />Figure 5.2.7: Impact of the Body Image Representation on Social media on Self-Esteem The pie chart showcases the presence of representation of body image in social media on self- esteem.

The prevalence of idealized body images on sites like Instagram, Facebook and other platforms, exploring psychological effects of such images on individuals (Merino et al. 2024). The research looks at the frequency with which these images are exposed to find out what emotional and cognitive impact it has on body satisfaction. Furthermore, the report further examines differences between genders in how male and female users perceive and react to body image portrayals. Peer pressure in these perceptions is also considered, particularly how social media can influence body image in a positive way (Chung et al. 2021). Potential solutions, including how to regulate the content, and to implement features by social media platforms in order to minimize the negative impacts are also discussed. It is essential to have healthier social media use behaviours to assess better self-esteem as well as the body image.<br />5.5 Chapter Summary</p>\n<p>This chapter evaluates the effect that social media representations of physical appearance have on body satisfaction and self-esteem as a function of young adult&rsquo;s age. It explores the way exposure to idealized body images is associated with perceptions, with special focus on gender<br /> <br />difference and influence of peers. It also discusses the possibility of content regulation on social media platforms to minimize the negative impact and provides insight into ways to make social media channels healthier and improve the body image. Additionally, it assesses the particular role of the individual differences within responding to the &ldquo;body image portrayals&rdquo;, such as gender alongside &ldquo;pre-existing body image&rdquo; concerning. It also focusses the significance of the media literacy alongside approaches for assessing &ldquo;positive body image&rdquo; through the awareness alongside adequate social media utilization.</p>\n<p>6. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION</p>\n<p>6.1 Conclusion<br />Different aspects have been taken into consideration during body image portrayal in social media like promotion of unrealistic beauty standards, indulging with celebrity endorsements and others. It can often be seen that social media portrays thinness and other body type approaches as ideal which develops the sense of dissatisfaction among the users. Influencers promote certain body types to make user perceive them as healthy or attractive for their own benefits. Exposure to the edited image also has been increased due to the social media while youth often compare their body type with the edited image that has been perceived as perfect leads to anxiety and negativity.<br />High dissatisfaction and low esteem regarding issues has been encountered by the users due to the exposure to &ldquo;Social media body image portrayal&rdquo;. Frequent exposure to the &ldquo;idealised body type&rdquo; influences the users to compare their body type of those exposed unrealistic images causes the issues of low self-esteem. In certain cases, it can also be seen that young people often engage with unmeasured weight control activities in the desire of getting a body shape like the image. This compulsive behaviour has also caused mental disturbance like anxiety, depression and other physical issues.<br />Societal degradation and self-objectification regarding approaches has emerged as a negative consequence of &ldquo;Social media body image portrayal&rdquo;. Due to these exposures young often tied their self- esteem and confidence with their appearance not with their capability and knowledge and the sense of being judged by others. Health regarding challenges also has been encountered by youth due to the exposure to the social media body image as they started to eat less to get the perceived idealised body type shown in the image. Highlighting the diversity of natural body type can be considered as one of the emerging approaches that can eliminate the negative impact of &ldquo;Social media body image portrayal&rdquo;.<br />6.2 Linking with objectives<br />&ldquo;Objective 1 of this research has been met in the 2.2 and 2.3 subsection of literature review chapter&rdquo; to explore the ways of portrayal of body image in Social media. Survey question 3 and 4 has been developed based on this objective.&rdquo;<br /> <br />&ldquo;Objective 2 has been met in the 2.4 and 2.5 subsections of the literature review chapter for evaluating the impact of portrayal of body image on social media on the consumption and interaction approaches of the youth. This objective has also helped in structuring the 5th and 7th question of the survey.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Objective 3 helped in developing the 2.6 subsection of the literature review chapter that has assessed the challenges faced by youth due to the portrayal of body image Social media.&rdquo; It has helped in developing survey question number 6.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Objective 4 has helped in developing the 2.7 subsection of literature review which indicates the strategies that can help to mitigate the challenges encountered by youth due to the exposure of unrealistic body images in Social media. This objective has also been met in the recommendation section of chapter 6.&rdquo;<br />6.3 Future Scope<br />This research will significantly contribute in documenting specific information which can be used by the future researcher during shedding light on such approaches. For instance, this research has specifically identified that the unmeasured diet approaches among youth is heavily driven by the exposure to unrealistic images in Social media. These findings will help the future researcher to support their own findings or broadening their knowledge over this subject to carry out further required measures.<br />6.4 Limitation of the study<br />Due to time restriction this research has considered a small sample size 51 which makes it difficult to generalise the findings to a larger population. Wide and representative sample evaluation has been challenging for this research as most of the targeted population avoid the survey as they have already become the victim of negative approaches of &ldquo;Social media body image portrayal&rdquo;. Deductive approach to some extent has limited this study to explore new approaches and dimensions regarding negative impact of &ldquo;Social media body image portrayal&rdquo;.<br />6.5 Recommendation<br />6.5.1 Highlighting the diversity of human body type<br />Exposure to unrealistic body image in social media has instigated the users to compare their body type with &ldquo;perceived&rdquo; idealised body type shown in the image. Considering this approach, diversity of human body type needs to be showcased through social media to break the faulty<br /> <br />concept of youth regarding idealised body type. For instance, Unilever has eradicated alteration of photography related to changing model&rsquo;s body type (Unilever, 2024). Concentrating on this factor during evaluating social media marketing companies and influencers needs to share unmodified body image for appreciating the diversity of body type and break the silos of &ldquo;perceived&rdquo; idealised body type approaches among the users.<br />6.5.2 Limiting the exposure to the negative influence of digital content<br />Technical advancement needs to be addressed by the R&amp;D teams of social media sites to restrict the promotion of hypothesised images. For instance, Facebook has mentioned that a user can only post photos or content that does not violate others&rsquo; intellectual property rights (Facebook, 2024). Concentrating on this approach social media firms like Facebook, Instagram can also regulate new rules as per which users cannot upload or share an edited image which bring changes to the body type, size, skin colour that virtually enhance the attractiveness of body image shown in the post. This factor would significantly help in elimination of exposure to enhanced &ldquo;Social media body image portrayal&rdquo;. Reduction to exposure would also help youth to understand and appreciate diversity of human body type and the issues due to exposure to enhanced body shape virtually, can be mitigated.<br />6.5.3 Evaluating the identification process of modified image<br />Technical knowledge of the social media users&rsquo; needs to be enhanced to make them able to recognise the use of filters and other photo editing tools. For instance, Facebook can add a new feature in their newsfeed section as per which users can identify the distort images which are responsible for unrealistic standards. Identification of those images would make the users understand that the standards are hypothesised which make them confident with their own body type. This factor would help eliminate the approaches of comparing their own body type with unrealistic images on Social media.</p>",

The findings within this dissertation will be significant to the future research into feminist film theory, particularly female sexual desires and how that can be shown more in films to in addition deconstructing the shameful stigma around it. Additionally, the impact of representing various male body types on a generation that is learning to leave the traditional ideas around the male body and masculinity behind. The research provided in this dissertation expands, challenges and supports the ideas from key theorist that had begun to delve into these topics, to uncover the importance of representing these topics and how it could have a positive impact on the minds of the audience. Furthermore, this dissertation will specifically provide an in-depth understanding of the correlation between gender behaviours, desires and body image, and how that all links to the representation of female sexual desires and male body image.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Introduction <br />Cinema is one of the biggest sectors in the entertainment industry using the medium of film to deliver a narrative that carries underlying messages or meanings, for the audience to interpret. For a long time, cinema has been catering to the male gaze, by sexualising female characters through clothing, behaviour, language, and body type (Slade, 2021). However, in the last two decades, the film industry has been exploring how to represent female desires, in particular sexual desires, and how to represent the different male body types in films. As film directors and producers have been challenging and breaking away from patriarchal ideologies (created by the patriarchy) around female sexual desires being non-existent, or the idea that the male body must have defined abs while not looking over muscular (Santoniccolo et al., 2023).<br />Researching into female sexual desires and male body image is significant. There have been numerous amounts of literature that looks at theses' topics, yet never fully explores them in depth. Feminist theory and feminist film theory examine these topics briefly when discussing the ideologies around sexuality, the concept of gaze and gender being a performance. Firstly, female sexual desires have been an ongoing topic of research within both theories, as it has been suggested that women enjoy being objectified, because that is the way the patriarchy have defined female desires (Straayer, 1984, p.67). Additionally, women have been crafted in films to become an erotic object of desire for both the male audiences and characters, which is defined as the male gaze (Mulvey, 1975). Secondly, when scholars have investigated the representation of masculinity or the way that men are represented in films, they often would briefly discuss male body image from the viewpoint of the cinematography, rather than the spectators. It was Neale (1983) that identified that &ldquo;We see male bodies stylised and fragmented by close-ups&rdquo; (p.14), highlighting that the reason that films for the last 40 years have been making male characters be toned, sculpted, and muscular (Lee, 2020), is because films have stylised the male body to fit the Hollywood image. Moreover, due to the lack of various male body types being shown in films, it has left male audiences and characters to feel the pressure to meet these ideals. <br />As previously stated, female sexual desires and male body image in film has yet to be researched in-depth, especially when looking at films made from 2010 and onwards. Representation is significant to the narratives in films, as it can affect the way spectators perceive the world around them and their sense of identity. Shabo (2023) expands on this and highlights that representation &ldquo;can lead to empowerment and a sense of belonging&rdquo; and that it &ldquo;reflect the realities of our real-life stories everyday&rdquo;. So, by investigating the representation of female sexual desires and male body image, it will examine the developments that have been made in the film industry to address it, as well as the way it has been presented to the spectators. <br />To investigate and examine the representation of female sexual desires and male body image in film a case study shall be selected. For this dissertation, it will use the The Magic Mike Trilogy &ndash; Magic Mike (Soderbergh, 2012), Magic Mike XXL (Jacobs, 2015) and Magic Mike&rsquo;s last Dance (Soderbergh, 2023) &ndash; in which the trilogy is exploring and developing the way female sexual desires can be represented within films from a a male and female perspective. As well as how traditional ideologies around masculinity and male body image is changing into a healthier way, showcasing that men can feel their emotions and that they do not need to be muscular or toned to be attractive. To conduct this study, it will use multimodal analysis to analyse the films through audio, visual and dialogue, because it allows a wilder scope to focus on the three key areas in this study: gender behaviours, desires and body image. The data will be collected through a codebook that will track the number of times a certain cue (audio, visual and dialogue) is shown in the certain themes. The dissertation hypothesis is that the role-reversal in The Magic Mike franchise has enabled women&rsquo;s sexual desires to be represented and has broken down the shameful stigma around it. Moreover, how there are various male body types that are attractive and will also enable the discussion of healthy masculinity to be represented and break the ideologies around traditional masculinity and male body types. <br />This dissertation is divided into five chapters. The first chapter is a review of different literature by theorists and scholars, from covering the three waves of feminist theory and then feminist film theory which discusses and analyses the gaze, and sexuality and desires. It should be noted that Feminist theory is the core farmwork for this dissertation that discusses gender, sexuality and desires. Whilst Feminist film theory is a sub framework that will support and expand on points made by the selected feminist theorists and will delves into the concepts of &lsquo;the gaze&rsquo;, and sexuality and desires within film. The second chapter covers the research question, the research aims, and the case study rationale. Chapter three covers the methodology, looking at the research methods and the data collection process. The fourth chapter will detail my analysis, and findings from my data collection, and discuss the results. The fifth and final chapter will summarise the dissertation by restating the question, the significance of the research, highlighting the key findings, and recommendations for further research into the topic. <br />Chapter 1: Literature Review<br />Feminist theory looks at fighting for equality for all genders economically, politically and socially. To achieve that it challenges gender inequality, the patriarchy, gender stereotypes, sexual freedom, and beyond (Smelik, 2016). It is continually developing and is an important theory to note as small steps are made in progression towards gender equality. There has been notable theorist such as Simone De Beauvoir, Bell Hooks, Judith Butler, Betty Friedan and Laura Bates, that have contributed to the work of feminist theory. As research into feminist theory continues to expand it has led into sub-theories, one of them being feminist film theory. <br />Feminist film theory was established in the 1970s to critically assess the representations of gender and sexuality within films (Hall, 2024). The core concepts in feminist film theory are the male gaze, how women are represented within film, and how audiences process films that impact their gender. There have been essays, articles, books and journals from Laura Mulvey, Angela McRobbie, Tania Modleski, Todd McGowan, Rachel Garfield, Jane Gaines, and Teresa de Lauretis, and more, who have research into the topics around gender, the gaze and sexuality. <br /> Furthermore, this literature review will be broken into three sections. The first section will be looking at the three different waves of feminist theory, the second section is the gaze, and the final section will address sexuality and desires. The literature that is presented in these sections will contribute to the overall discussion and findings of this research.<br />Feminist Theory <br />The world of cinema has evolved over the years. This has led to the increase in female and LGBTQ+ leads seen within films, and in positions of being a writer or director. Since the early days of silent cinema in 1894, the role of the female was to support the male as a love interest or a damsel-in-distress without adding much input to the overall narrative of the film. As Price (2024) noted; &ldquo;Cinema has long served as a mirror to society's views on gender&rdquo; which has contributed to the various developments in gender stereotypes and how people view their gender roles. For example, women are now able to a boss and control her whole life, without an input of man. <br />It was not until the second wave of feminism in the 1960s and 1970s did the discussions around gender equality and discrimination begin to arise. Simeone De Beauvoir was a core part of the second wave of feminist theorists. De Beauvoir et al. wrote a book called The Second Sex (1949/2000), which explores the lives and treatment of women in a patriarchal society. Within the text De Beauvoir et al. states &ldquo;The representation of the world as the world itself is the work of men; they describe it from a point of view that is their own and that they confound with the absolute truth.&rdquo; (p.196). Here De Beauvoir et al. is referring to how men have created a narrative that fits the patriarchal culture and is essentially saying that a woman has no place or voice to make a judgment on the view of the world. Later in the book, De Beauvoir et al. delves into the way &ldquo;Patriarchal civilization condemned woman to chastity; the right of man to relieve his sexual desires is more or less openly recognized, whereas woman is confined within marriage&rdquo; (p.444). This is significant because it is only recently that films have started to touch upon the sexuality and desires of females and LGBTQ+ and how it should be represented in film. Whereas men&rsquo;s sexuality and desires are still the most openly recognised in films, due to the vast number of films that cater to the male audience (or known as the male gaze). <br />The Second Sex (1949/2000) by De Beauvoir et al. has influenced the development in feminist film theory. This is because it offered a critical perspective of the patriarchal society that is often reflected in films, as the male lead character is supported by the female character, reinforcing that idea of gender stereotypes (CinemaWaves Team, 2025). <br />By the 1990s the third wave of feminist theorists started to appear and expanded their focus on reclaiming sexuality, sexual violence, reproductive rights, empowerment, and intersectionality (MasterClass, 2020); this is reflected in the numerous works of critics who evaluated the various limitations of the second wave. This led theorist such as Judith Bulter to discuss new and old ideas of feminism. It resulted in her book, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (1990), which discusses the concept of gender being performative, by looking at how a gender performs based of how they dress or speak, or act based of the social constructs created by society. Butler continued in the vein of De Beauvoir; whom she quotes &ldquo;One is not born a woman, but rather becomes one&rdquo; (De Beauvoir et al., 1949/2000 cited by Butler, 1990, P.1), meaning that women learn to become one by leaning how to act, dress and speak as women. This caused Butler to propose that &ldquo;The action of gender requires a performance that is repeated. The repetition is at once a reenactment and re-experiencing of a set of meanings already socially established&rdquo; (p.191). The quote itself is signifying that gender is performative and that it is not what one is when they are born, as the expectations, past-experiences and understanding of what a woman is or what a man is has long been established in society. This leads to the stereotyping of genders, specifically of women and how they should look, dress, speak and react in certain situations, which later ends up being the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; for portraying women in the media, especially in films. Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (1990) critically evaluated how gender is performative and beyond a fixed idea. This book by Butler enables feminist film theorist to critically view films from re-evaluating how gender is represented and portrayed in films and allows an additional perspective when analysing the different film gazes. <br />Following on from the developments of the third wave, the fourth wave (current wave) began, and has been focused on tackling sexual harassment, body shaming and rape culture (Brunell &amp; Burkett, 2024). Due to the increased access and development of social media, this wave has seen movements such as #metoo raising awareness about sexual violence (Burke, 2024). As these topics are an expansion of the various focus points across the history of feminist theory, a notable fourth wave feminist theorist is Rebecca Solnit who wrote the book Men Explain Things to Me (2014). This book delves into how men presume that they know more than women even when the topic is related to women, and how men always try to find a way to maintain some type of power over women by silencing them. Early within book, Solnit states that &ldquo;Most women fight wars on two fronts, one for whatever the putative topic is and one simply for the right to speak, to have ideas, to be acknowledged, to be in possession of facts and truths, to have value, to be a human being.&rdquo; (P.11). It is highlighting that even for the most simplistic things women are still fighting to be seen and heard beyond the narrative that has been created by the patriarchy. This can be seen in modern day cinema, as there is a slight increase in the number of films being produced to showcase woman&rsquo;s feelings, thoughts and the values that they bring to the world. Solnit also delves into the impact that feminism had on same-sex marriage; &ldquo;And feminism made same-sex marriage possible by doing so much to transform a hierarchical relationship into an egalitarian one.&rdquo; (p.35), therefore because of the research by feminist theorists and the protests by feminists it has enabled the LGBTQ+ to have the same option to get married and to be seen and heard like everyone else. <br /> In addition, the fight for gender equality has enabled both parties in a relationship to equally share of power and responsibilities. On the contrary to the traditional stereotypes surrounding relationships, where the man has all the power in the relationship. A Marriage Story (Baumbach, 2019) is an example of how films have showcased the elements of the egalitarian and hierarchical approach in narrative. However, it also showed how the elements of hierarchy in the relationship, from the male lead, cause the couple to divorce demonstrating the egalitarian perspective of the couple respecting each other post-divorce for the sake of their son and for them to work on themselves. <br />The various waves of feminism have influenced the creation of feminist films globally (e.g films like She Said (Schrader, 2022), 9 to 5 (Higgins, 1981), and Persepolis (Satrapi &amp; Paronnaud, 2007) which has challenged the gender stereotypes, the patriarchy and more. Since 2010 there has been a slow development of films showcasing the feminist perspective and allowing female and LGBTQ+ to have a voice about their identities, desires, the importance of gender equality and everything feminist have been fighting for. <br />The films that are now being produced have begun to impact the minds of viewers of all genders and ages, as there are more subtle elements in children shows for them to learn from; and documentaries and &ldquo;close-to-reality&rdquo; films that touch upon topics of sexual desires, fighting against the patriarchy, and more. With films being constantly produced, feminist film theorist have been examing over the years of how gender and sexuality is represented and shaped within modern cinema. <br />The Gazes<br />For centuries, Hollywood has been a male dominated industry, creating films that cater to the desires of the male gaze. Who Framed Roger Rabbit (Zemeckis, 1988) and Transformers (Bay, 2007) are two examples of many films that look to appease the male gaze by sexualising the female characters through their outfits, intelligence and the way they speak. Although, the film industry has developed and is only now starting to properly cater more for the female, transgender, non-binary, and beyond gazes. However, majority of films that are created today will still aimed to cater to the male gaze. <br />The idea of the gazes, specifically the male gaze, was introduced in 1975 by Laura Mulvey in her work &lsquo;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema&rsquo;. In &lsquo;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema&rsquo; (1975) Mulvey uses Lacan&rsquo;s and Freud&rsquo;s theories of psychoanalysis to understand how films create pleasure in the minds of the audience, and how Hollywood specifically feeds into the minds of the male gaze while forgetting about the female gaze. Mulvey argues that &ldquo;Woman then stands in patriarchal culture as a signifier for the male other[...]imposing them on the silent image of women tied to her place as a bearer, not maker, of meaning&rdquo; (p.59), thus highlighting the way how the patriarchal culture in society and the film industry have created a mould that they want women to fit into. More specifically to fulfil the desires of men whilst ignoring the desires of women. Further into &lsquo;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema&rsquo;, Mulvey observes that &ldquo;the woman as object of the combined gaze of spectator and all the male protagonists in the film. She is isolated, glamorous, on display, sexualised. [...] through participating in his power, the spectator can indirectly possess her too.&rdquo; (p.64), referring to how the various thoughts and viewpoints from the male spectators draw on, and from the comments, thoughts and acts by the male characters that they see within the film. <br />Nevertheless, it should be noted that &lsquo;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema&rsquo; (1975) has been evaluated by various critics and scholars, including Mulvey, who revisited it in her 2019 collection of essays, and noted various elements missed within this text. Guo (2023) reviewed how relevant &lsquo;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema&rsquo; (1975) is today, and recognised limitations such as &ldquo;only the male gaze and desire are explored in depth (p.14) and &ldquo;ignores the desires and needs of the female population and the LGBTQ community&rdquo; (p.15). These observations offer a critical analysis of how using this text to analyse films would be hard because of the lack of exploration and analysis on the desires of females and LGBTQ+ community. Considering the text being 50 years old, and that cinema has developed a lot since the release of this text. However, the text has relative elements of credibility as it introduces the idea of the gazes by focusing on the male gaze, also some of the points that are made are still credible to refer to. <br />After the work by Mulvey, there has been various developments at how the gaze could be viewed and the perspectives from being the object of the gaze. Steve Neale developed Mulvey&rsquo;s idea of the gaze but also critiqued it. He used the work of Mulvey to develop an analysis of how heterosexual males are represented in cinema. In Neale&rsquo;s work, Masculinity as Spectacle (1983) this article specifically discussed how the male body is not seen as an object of sexual display and nor are they for the spectator's gaze. In the article Neale states, &ldquo;male figures on the screen are subject to voyeuristic looking, both on the part of the spectator and on the part of other male character&rdquo; (p.12) referring to the idea that the male body image is bound to be looked upon from both the spectator and other male characters, as the male body can be objectified just as the Mulvey&rsquo;s idea of the male gaze objectifying female characters. However, the male body can also be an object of desire for the spectators and other male characters, whether that be the wish to attain the physical physique or how they act, as they get seen as a whole person. Further into the article, Neale identities that &ldquo;We are offered the spectacle of male bodies, but bodies unmarked as objects of erotic display.&rdquo; (p.14), this is following on from his point that the male body is openly gazed upon, but the male gets to be viewed as a whole person with actions and feelings, rather than just been seen for their body. In contrast with how women get seen and sexualised for their bodies before being seen as a complex character, which was one of Mulvey&rsquo;s key arguments that led to Neale&rsquo;s development of how the heterosexual male are represented in cinema. <br />Neale&rsquo;s argument enables a critical analysis of Mulvey&rsquo;s work and uses it as a foundation to discuss how heterosexual males are represented within cinema and how the male body can be objectified, just like the female characters, but the male character is more likely to be seen beyond a sexual display. In addition, it sheds a new light on the idea of the gaze, expanding on Mulvey&rsquo;s &lsquo;male gaze&rsquo; concept, but looks at it from spectators and the other character&rsquo;s perspective. Although, this article is a few years younger than Mulvey&rsquo;s, which does make it slightly outdated, it still adds a significant perspective in that it adds to the in-depth discussion around the way male body image and heterosexual males are represented and viewed in cinema. <br />In the 1990s queer theory was introduced to challenge gender and social norms, specifically related to gender and sexuality. Within this field of theory was the development of queer gaze concept, which &ldquo;recognizes how lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people create and view art.&rdquo; (Anderson, 2018), resulting in the way the LGBTQ+ community is represented in cinema. It challenged the traditional ideas around sexuality and desire, and the objectification that females and the LGBTQ+ community face when being represented in films. <br />In the book A Queer Romance (2005), the chapter &lsquo;The Gaze Revisited or Reviewing Queer Viewing&rsquo; by Caroline Evans and Lorraine Gamman, revisits the concept and history of the gaze, especially Mulvey&rsquo;s &lsquo;male gaze&rsquo; concept. This is while looking at the importance of expanding the idea around the queer gaze beyond just the experiences of gay and lesbian spectators (Evans &amp; Gamman, 2005, p.13). In this chapter, Evans and Gamman state &ldquo;We are probably as perverse in our looking habits as many &lsquo;essentially&rsquo; gay or lesbian spectators, and only by introducing some queer notions can we begin to explain our experiences beyond the dogma of ideas associated with the meaning of specific sexual orientations.&rdquo; (p.42). They are highlighting that by introducing queer notions and perspectives into the gaze, it will allow an in-depth understanding of their experiences that go beyond the stereotypical belief of how people of a certain sexual orientation may act or be. It is a significant notion to refer to the queer gaze as it is still being researched as to how to represent the LGBTQ+ community within films and accurately depict their actions, experiences and beyond. Additionally, there have been films that have explored the reality and sensitivity side that appeal to the LGBTQ+ spectators and enable them to see that the world of cinema is opening a space for the gaze. <br />The gaze has developed a long way from the initial concept of the &lsquo;male gaze&rsquo; from Mulvey to the early stages of developing the notions of queer gaze in 2005 by Evans and Gamman. Nonetheless, the different stages have captured the various elements of how the gaze and spectatorship have developed, especially in analysing the way one&rsquo;s body can be seen as a sexual object or it can be seen beyond that. In addition to the way certain experiences can relate to how the spectators view their lives and themselves. <br />Sexuality and Desires<br />The discussions around sexuality and desires have been constant since the second wave of feminism. This is because many previous films were typically tailored for male audiences. During the Golden Age of Hollywood era of cinema (1930s to 1960s), the Hays Code was introduced. This provided censorship of the material filmmakers could use. It limited depictions of violence, sexual acts, profanity and anything that would be considered controversial (Heckmann, 2021). Consequently, most of the films during that period would fit within the patriarchal society and the gender roles reflective of that time. It is important to note that the films that were produced and allowed to be published did have moments of representing some male desires.<br />It was not until the 1960s, during the second wave of feminism, that the discussion around sexuality and desires finally started to appear in films, whilst also addressing major topics such as abortion, gender equality, and sexual exploration. In the current era of cinema, we are seeing more films being produced to catering to wider audiences, specifically LGBTQ+ and female. Their desires and sexuality are being explored in a realistic narrative, while adressing the developments in how masculinity is being represented away from the traditional ideology of masculinity. <br />There have been numerous essays, scholarly articles, journals and books that have looked at the way sexuality and desires are represented in films that are not only limited to addressing the male gaze. In 1984, Chris Straayer reviewed the works of Women&rsquo;s Pictures: Feminism and Cinema by Annette Kuhn and Women and Film: Both Sides of the Camera by E. Ann Kaplan. Within this review, Straayer discussed the contributions of both Kuhn and Kaplan in feminist film theory and their criticism of the way women are presented within cinema. In particular, Straayer notes about Kaplan&rsquo;s application of Mulvey&rsquo;s &lsquo;male gaze&rsquo; theory to analyse how women are illustrated in film, which leads to his recognition that &ldquo;Women's sexuality frightens men&rdquo; (p.67). Showing that men feel threatened when a woman decides to change or shift her gaze to herself and her desires. The male gaze becomes threatened as the narrative of sex and desire was created by men for their own pleasures falls apart. This idea plays a role in the discussion and development of women&rsquo;s desires being represented onscreen in film. Whilst the male gaze has repeatedly portrayed women to have no desires besides being a loving wife or mother and service the needs of men they are involved with. The male gaze excludes them from having the freedom to explore their sexuality and desires. <br />Straayer&rsquo;s review of the works of Kaplan and Kuhn gave an insight into the early recognition of the awaking and development of women&rsquo;s desires beyond the concept of motherhood, created by the male gaze. Considering this review (and the original texts) are dated, it still has a useful amount of analysis that looks at the way women are presented in cinema, especially their desires, as well as touching upon element of the gaze which is beneficial in understanding how it affects the spectators and can be used to an extent to analysis modern films.<br />As the development into the ways sexuality and desires are represented in films continued to be explored, in 1998 Anneke Smelik publish the book called And the Mirror Cracked which look at feminist film theory. In particular, the chapter &lsquo;What Meets the Eye: An Overview of Feminist Film Theory&rsquo;, discusses the way feminist theorists have looked at films through the frame of gender and the way women have been viewed and represented in cinema. Within the text Smelik suggests that &ldquo;Sexual desire is intimately bound up with the desire for knowledge&rdquo; (p.16), she is implying that the mystery of working out what another person wants becomes a quest of excitement. In other words, in films women have been subjected to being seen as a &lsquo;mystery&rsquo;, which leads to men chasing after her because he&rsquo;s intrigued and fascinated by her, that his sexual desires are fuelled by wanting to know more about her and understand what she wants. Leading on from this, Smelik further discusses that &ldquo;The female subject is the effect of a certain habitual experience of sexuality, both within herself and in relation to the outer world: to change the female subject is to change experience - in other words to change habit.&rdquo; (p.18), therefore if the role of women in films was shifted that would change their experiences and habits, which allows them to be more than just a subject for Mulvey&rsquo;s male gaze concept. <br />Smelik makes strong augments throughout the text, especially on the concept of desire and the portrayal of women in film. Her analysis of desire fills the gaps around the stemming of desire and expands on Mulvey&rsquo;s perspective of viewing women in film from the male gaze. As Mulvey (1975) said &ldquo;pleasure in looking has been split between active/male and passive/female. The determining male gaze projects its phantasy on to the female form which is styled accordingly.&rdquo; (p.62), which relates to Smelik discussing how women have been crafted in films to be a mystery as it&rsquo;s been styles that way for the male gaze. <br />Chapter 2: Research Question, Aims &amp; Case Study Rationale<br />Research Question and Aims<br />Upon researching into feminist theory and feminist film theory, it was identifiable that female sexual desires and male body image were the least discussed topics. This led to the idea of wanting to examine the way films represent women&rsquo;s sexual desires and male body image. In particular, the way women&rsquo;s sexual desires are portrayed and represented in films, and how films have been breaking away from the concept of toxic masculinity, that has been known to leave men with an unrealistic view of their bodies (Lee, 2020), and how films can portray and represent a healthy concept of masculinity that leave men with positive feelings about their body add express their emotions.<br />The research question for this dissertation is &lsquo;How has the role reversal throughout the Magic Mike franchise represented women's sexual desires and male body image?'. To ensure that this research question is answered by the end of this dissertation, the question has been broken down into four distinct aims, as follows: <br />1. How has the franchise deconstructed the shameful stigma around women's sexual desire?<br />2. Why is the representation of healthy masculinity important in breaking down people's ideologies around hegemonic masculinity?<br />3. How has the character development of Mike showcase healthy masculinity throughout the franchise in comparison to other male characters?<br />4. How has the franchise overall played a part in discussing and addressing toxic masculinity in modern society and its effects on men's mental health?<br />Case Study Rationale: The Magic Mike Trilogy<br />The Magic Mike Trilogy (Soderbergh, 2012; Jacobs, 2015; Soderbergh, 2023) begins with Magic Mike (Soderbergh, 2012). Here we first meet Mike Lane (played by Channing Tatum) who is a stripper and roofer but wants to do more with his life. We also meet second lead Adam (played by Alex Pettyfer) who has moved from job to job until he meets Mike, who brings him into the world of male stripping. In this film, it looks at the female sexual desires through the male perceptive of what they believe will fulfil women&rsquo;s sexual desires, without the male characters feeling like they are losing any aspect of their masculinity. However, the film does touch on the issues of masculinity relating to body image, as some of the male characters enhance their body before going on stage to increase their sex appeal. Following on from this, Magic Mike XXL (Jacobs, 2015) is three years later where Mike has retired from stripping and is focused on setting up his business, however Mike is missing the thrill of being on stage with his friends, who are a part of the Kings of Tampa. This film shifts from the male perspective of female sexual desires into the development of a female perspective. Because the audience meets Rome (played by Jada Pinkett Smith), one of the females leads in this film, who runs her own stripping empire catering to the female gaze and desires. Whilst this is happening, the film starts to breakdown the ideologies around masculinity, as the male characters start to open up emotionally about their feelings and explore their sexuality outside of the gender stereotypes created by society. The final film, Magic Mike&rsquo;s Last Dance (Soderbergh, 2023), follows Mike to London having been made an offer by Maxandra (played by Salma Hayek) to revive a piece of theatre through dance. In this final film, it depicts a narrative of what females truly desire sexual and how that should be shown through a narrative fuelled by emotions, rather than just men stripping. Moreover, it shows that male stripping does not have to be overly sexualised (in comparison to the last two films) to fuel female sexual desires and reflects on how Mike&rsquo;s evolution over the trilogy has broken away from traditional masculinity ideology. <br />Though briefly explaining the trilogy, the films have broken down the stigmas around women&rsquo;s sexual desire, and the ideologies around masculinity and male body image. The Magic Mike Trilogy (Soderbergh, 2012; Jacobs, 2015; Soderbergh, 2023) tackles the representation of women&rsquo;s sexual desires and male body image through using role-reversal in all three films. In the films, role-reversal is used to demonstrate the difference of how the male body is not as objectified by the female gaze but is sexualised. In comparisons to how the majority of films that have ever been created have objectified women for the male gaze. Additionally, the role-reversal in the trilogy allows the female characters to add to the developments to outcome of how female sexual desires are represented in the trilogy, whilst deconstructing the shameful stigma around female sexual desires. Considering all this, it was apparent the The Magic Mike Trilogy (Soderbergh, 2012; Jacobs, 2015; Soderbergh, 2023) was a suitable case study to analyse female sexual desires and male body image. <br />Chapter 3: Methodology<br />This chapter of the dissertation will deal with the research method chosen, the rationale behind using the method and how the data will be collected to answer the research question. <br />Primary Research <br />Primary research is used when a researcher wishes to collect original data that is specifically relevant to the research question, as there may be limited data available to help answer the research question (Hunt, 2024). <br />There are many ways to conduct primary research. Methods such as observations, interviews, surveys or focus groups, are those&rsquo;d which Driscoll (2010) has noted that it enables the researcher to get direct answers by asking others or by making their own observations (p.157). Primary research, however, has its limitations in that it can affect the data collection process and results. These limitations are due to insufficient amount of data that leads to the need for second data research, which can be time consuming, and prone to biases which can distort and mislead the data analysis and conclusion (George, 2023). <br />When considering how to answer the research question, it was apparent that primary research would have to be conducted due to the limited amount of data being available when examining the representation of female sexual desires and the male body image within films. When researching the various ways to conduct primary research, it was clear that an observational research approach would be an appropriate way to analyse The Magic Mike Trilogy (Soderbergh, 2012; Jacobs, 2015; Soderbergh, 2023) because it allows the analysis of body langue, emotions, and reactions of all characters and extras. Having researched the numerous observational approaches, multimodal analysis was the strongest because of its ability to analyse text, images, audio and more. <br />Multimodal Analysis <br />As previously stated, multimodal analysis was the chosen research method for this dissertation. This type of analysis &ldquo;refers to the process of interpreting and making sense of qualitative data in projects that mix verbal and nonverbal forms of information.&rdquo; (Dicks, 2020). It is a strong method to use when analysing The Magic Mike Trilogy (Soderbergh, 2012; Jacobs, 2015; Soderbergh, 2023) because it enables the examination of visual elements, language (body and facial expressions), colours (lighting), sound and more, which facilitates the analysis of the trilogy through a wider lens and provides room for the in-depth analysis of how women's sexual desires and male body image are represented in those films. Although this method allows a wider lens to analyse the film, it does have some limitations. As noted by Bezemer &amp; Jewitt (2010), multimodal analysis can risk wrapping up things into one meaning (p.194). In other words, the method requires the researcher to be aware that certain themes or elements that they are observing for can accidently cross-over making the researcher believe it to mean one thing, when in reality it can mean something else. <br />To use multimodal analysis, a clear the data collection process must be set to understand the narrative and the experiences characters experience in the trilogy. There are various methods of data collection such as surveys, interviews, online research and observational (ReconMR, 2024). This dissertation will be using an observational data collection process and will place the data collected in a quantitative codebook. The use of a quantitative codebook will breakdown three key areas; gender behaviours, desire, and body image. The code will have codes related to each theme. <br /> <br />(Figure 1: Codebook demonstration with actual results)<br />As demonstrated in figure 1, the theme male objectification (has been coded as MO) has a specific description of what it means, so that it enables specific cues (visual, dialogue or audio) to be created, that will allow me to narrow the scope of what will be observed while watching all three films. While watching out for the specific cues in each film, boxes will be filled with tallies and calculated at the end to observe the number of times a cue has occurred in across the trilogy. Once the data has been collected, it will be analysed to identify any patterns that have appeared and interpret the meanings. For example, due to the frequency of male objectification, it may indicate that the male body it&rsquo;s important part of meeting the desires of the audience. This would then be supported by the theorists and scholars previously mentioned in the literature review to provide support in answering the research question.<br />Limitations<br />As stated earlier, there are potential limitations to this study. The core limitation is the amount of attention that is required to fully analyse the film. As Bezemer &amp; Jewitt (2010) recognised that it requires &ldquo;Too much attention to many different modes may take away from understanding&rdquo; (p.194). In other words, the method requires the researcher to focus on different elements to analyse the case study, which can take away from the actual understanding of the case study and research itself. This limitation would require at least a minimum of watching the films twice to make sure the different focal areas have been noted for the correct themes and cues. The way to address this limitation is to watch the films a minimum of three times and focus on one specific area at a time to ensure that focal areas have been analysed accurately. <br />Ethical Considerations <br />From an ethical standpoint, this research does not have any major ethical concerns. This is due to the films being within the public domain. This means that the films (or other media material) have been copyrighted or trademarked, allowing myself and the public to have full access to watch and use without needing to obtain a company or a person&rsquo;s consent to use it (Collister, 2024). In addition, all literature that has been used were obtained from the public domain. However, it would be wise to potentially note a minor ethical concern for this research, namely unconscious bias. This could change the way I view the film, even if I am not fully aware. To avoid that from happening, I will rewatch the films a minimum of three times, to ensure I am actively listening and engaging with the characters to understand their emotions and behaviours. <br />Yet, after reading the Coventry University Ethics Board guidance, it was clear that this research would ethically be considered low risk, because it does not have any data that will be needed to be collected from participants, meaning that there are no anonymity, data protection issues and other concerns.<br />Chapter 4: Discussion and Analysis<br />In this chapter, it will discuss and analyse the main findings from the multimodal analysis. The aim in to interpret the findings that have appeared, how it showcases new insights on the female sexual desires and male body image and how the results have either challenged the literature or supported it. This will be broken down into the three areas; gender behaviours, desire, and body image, and will use the key three areas themes to analyse and answer the research question and aims.<br />Gender Behaviours <br />This area focuses on the way certain genders act withing the film, that reflects certain gender norms. &ldquo;Gender is culturally constructed: hence, gender is neither the causal result of sex nor as seemingly fixed as sex. (Butler, 1990, p.9), meaning that gender is not a fixed concept because there is no way to determine someone&rsquo;s sexuality or gender. This makes Butler (1990) the core theorist for breaking down the results of this theme. In addition to using De Beauvoir et al. (1949/2000) research on how the patriarchy have create a society to fit their ideals, and Smelik (1998) idea of how feminist theorist at films through the frame of gender.<br />In appendix 1, the area of gender behaviours was broken down into themes that would allow an oversight into how different genders are represented throughout the trilogy. It was apparent that, gender expectations and male control, had the highest appearance across the trilogy, while the theme, intimacy and vulnerability, appeared the least number of times across. This could imply that there is still a long way to go in showcasing male vulnerability about their sexuality, desires and more. <br />Gender Expectations<br />Appendix 1 shows that gender expectations was the first theme that appeared the most times throughout the trilogies, with the total appearance of 97 times. The result demonstrates that the male characters continue to showcase certain characteristics that reflect the traditional gender norms. When reflecting on this result, it was apparent that it reflected Butler&rsquo;s (1990) idea that gender is performative; &ldquo;There is no gender identity behind the expressions of gender; that identity is performatively&rdquo; (p.34). The quote implies that there is no way to analyse a gender based on gender expressions but through how they perform that gender identity. Which is shown when certain male characters aim to assert their dominance through moments of dialogue or by showing off their muscles as much as they can. <br />This leads to the male characters competing to be dominant or the sexiest performer when stripping. This can lead to toxic masculinity amongst men, as they start to behaviour, speak and act differently. Although this happens quite a few throughout the trilogy, especially by using Adam as an example in Magic Mike (Soderbergh, 2012). However, Mike develops a healthy masculine ideology (in comparison to the rest of the characters) as throughout the trilogy he grows his emotional intelligence (enabling to end up in a secure relationship at the end of Magic Mike&rsquo;s Last Dance (Soderbergh, 2023), empathetic to the people around him, and allows himself to be vulnerable with the friends in Kings of Tamp and outside of that group. <br />Male Control<br />Leading on from gender expectations, male control was the second was reoccurring theme throughout the trilogy, by appearing 91 times. Male control looks at the way male characters assert their dominance between each other, the audience or their partners (or one-time fling) by using their sexuality. Throughout the trilogy, it is seen that the male characters are the object of desire and are being objectified for female pleasure. However, as Smelik (1998) suggested &ldquo;reversal of roles keeps the underlying structures of dominance and submission intact.&rdquo; (p.13), meaning that even with the roles being reversed (the male characters being the spectacle and female characters being the spectator), that this does not change who has the power dynamic as the ideas around power have been structed around the ideals by the patriarchy. The results validate this point made by Smelik (1998), as in image A, it shows Maxandra being submissive to Mike, who is performing for her at her own request. Yet, although she asked for the performance, she has no true power in this situation as he dominates her through the performance. <br />(Image A: Scene from Magic Mike&rsquo;s Last Dance (Soderbergh, 2023, 09:14))<br />It is important recognise this, as women have been trying for years to reclaim their sexual desires outside of the shameful construct created by the patriarchy. Yet, by examining Maxandra&rsquo;s actions of her allowing Mike to dominate her, it reflects the submissive narrative that men have created to confine female desires. Moreover, female desires were the most appeared theme within desire, which will be delved into later. <br />Intimacy and Vulnerability<br />As stated earlier, Mike has evolved over the trilogy and has ended up being an example of what healthy masculinity looks like. However, from the data in appendix 1 it was visible that the theme, intimacy and vulnerability was the appeared 24 times across the trilogy and was the lowest theme within sexuality to appear. It is surprising to see that result, as the three films have been made in years where discussions around toxic and healthy masculinity had become an extremely important topic of discussion due to content creators like Adrew Tate was creating misogynistic content on social media, which lead to certain male influencers starting to use their social media following for positive avocation for men&rsquo;s &ldquo;mental health, fitness and wellness, parenting, self-love, self-expression&rdquo; (Hern, 2024). <br />Although, the data wasn&rsquo;t as expected, it is still impressive for the trilogy to demonstrate these core elements of what healthy masculinity looks like, which can help women indicate the signs and behaviours of when a man is using his masculinity toxically or healthily. Nonetheless, the results validate De Beauvoir et al. (1949/2000) idea that &ldquo;The representation of the world as the world itself is the work of men; they describe it from a point of view that is their own and that they confound with the absolute truth.&rdquo; (p. 196). In other words that men have created this narrative for themselves were showing emotions or looking less masculine is a sign of weakness and can feel emasculated. Despite that, the trilogy is leading the charge of how to represent healthy masculinity within films, and the steps to take to help the spectators and male characters break away from the traditional ideologies of masculinity. <br />Desire<br />Appendix 2 focuses on how the various types of desires in life is represent throughout the trilogy, especially sexually, as Smelik (1998) recognised that &ldquo;Voyeuristic visual pleasure is produced by looking at another (character, figure, situation) as our object, whereas narcissistic visual pleasure can be derived from identification with the (figure in the) image.&rdquo; (p.9). Desire is a big part of everyone&rsquo;s life as it can range from romantic, sexual, materialistic or physical. To examine the themes within desire, it will draw upon the works of Mulvey (1999) and Straayer (1984) who were discussed in the literature review, to examine the results found in desire. After calculating the data, female desire appeared the greatest number of times across the trilogy<br />Female Desire<br />One of the main themes within the trilogy is Female desire. Female desire appeared a total of 142 times across the trilogy. This theme observed the way female characters display their sexual thoughts or emotions to others. This result strongly indicates that females have millions of sexual desires that the trilogy have showcased through the reactions, dialogue and actions of the female characters and extras. Straayer (1984), stated &ldquo;Women identify with and enjoy their own objectification because patriarchy constructs and defines their desire.&rdquo; (P.67), implying that all women enjoy being objectified because that&rsquo;s how the patriarchy has confined them to believe, which is far for the truth, as not all women have been objectified. The results prove that female sexual desires do not stem from being objectified, but what they find attractive or appealing.<br /> <br /> (Image B: Scene from Magic Mike XXL (Jacobs, 2015, 1:39:15))<br /> <br />(Image C: Scene from Magic Mike XXL (Jacobs, 2015, 1:43:12))<br /> In image B and Image C, the scenes contrast each other. In Image B, one of the female audience members (extras) is enjoying her time with Ken (played by Matt Bomer) who has just serenaded her with a song, instead of stripping. Whereas in Image C, the other female audience members (extras) female is getting frottaged by Big Dick Richie (played by Joe Manganiello) during his performance. Yet, by observing both females&rsquo; reactions and behaviours, they are clearing enjoying themselves and see to have their sexual desires filled <br />Based on results and the examples given in the images of B and C, it opposes Mulvey&rsquo;s idea that a &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s desires is subjugated to her image as bearer of bleeding wound; she can exist only in relation to castration and cannot transcend it.&rdquo; (p.59). This is significant as women have been subjected to only serving the male gaze and the patriarchy, and that the idea that a women should have any desires breaks down the concept that women&rsquo;s desires only exist in what they men choose for her. However, based on the data, it clear suggests otherwise and shows that there is no reason for women to feel afraid to fulfil their sexual desires, as there is now more films that are catering to the female gaze. Ultimately, deconstructing the shameful stigma around women&rsquo;s sexual desires. <br />Body Image<br />Body image is an area to examine to in-depth when analysing films. Due to Hollywood creating an &lsquo;ideals&rsquo; around what body types are worthy enough to appear on screen. In appendix 3, it evaluates how characters feel about their own body, the number of times a certain body type appears and how often a male or females&rsquo; body is objectified. This area will use the works of Neale (1983) to discuss the topic of male objectification, specifically of the male body. <br />Male Objectification<br />In appendix 3, male objectification appeared a total of 178 times throughout the trilogy, suggesting that the male characters within the film are to satisfy the eyes of their spectators (audience and female characters) through their sex appeal, behaviour or physical appearance. This is significant as there has been an ongoing discussion about whether men and their bodies are as objectified as females. From my results it challenges, Neale&rsquo;s (1983) argument that &ldquo;We [the audience] are offered the spectacle of male bodies, but bodies unmarked as objects of erotic display.&rdquo; (p.12), as he suggesting that the male body is not objectified for an erotic viewing.<br /> <br />(Image D: Scene from Magic Mike (Soderbergh, 2012, 1:40:06))<br />Yet, based on the works of Evans &amp; Gamman (2005), my results and the film scene in image D, would indicate and support their idea that the male body has been offered as an erotic object to the female characters and film spectators, allowing them to objectify the men and their bodies for their own desires. Additionally, becoming increasingly on display and sexualised (Evans &amp; Gamman, 2005, p.32)<br /> It&rsquo;s important to note that due to amount of time the male characters are objectified throughout the trilogy that this can affect the characters mental health and how they act. This links to the aim of how the trilogy addresses toxic masculinity in modern society and the effects on men&rsquo;s mental health. An example of this is the character Adam in Magic Mike (Soderbergh, 2012), as he goes from being a &ldquo;kid&rdquo; that is an amazing performer to a cocky, aggressive and violent. Mike tries to help Alex escape the toxic world he is creating for himself, but Alex pushes Mike (who has been a close friend away) as he believes he better than the rest and leaves to go to Miami to continue his stripping career.<br />Chapter 5: Conclusion<br />This dissertation has investigated &lsquo;How has the role reversal throughout the Magic Mike franchise represented women's sexual desires and male body image?&rsquo;. The evidence from this study suggests that, although the women are the spectators and the male characters are the spectacle of the gaze, it&rsquo;s clear that the power is still held in the hand of the male characters to a certain extent. This is because in the first film, the male characters control the type of performance they do and are selective with which female audience members they interact with, which showcases that the male characters have the power. However, by the third film the performance become more tailored a romantic thrilling performance that is not overly sexualising the male body, but this is due to have two empowering females, Maxandra and Hannah (played by Juliette Motamed) who speak up about what women truly desires and want to see. Based on the research results within this dissertation have indicated that The Magic Mike Trilogy does use role reversal to a certain extent to represent women&rsquo;s sexual desires and male body image.<br />Future Research <br />Finally, this dissertation has thrown up questions that will need to be research future, as this dissertation has given a gate way into the exploration of how female sexual desires and male body image is represented within film. Going forward, furthermore needs to be done to establish whether there will eventually be space for more movies to advocate for discussing women&rsquo;s sexual desires, and how can it be represented within film without making the women seem crazy for the need of a male partner or attention. </p>",

Through a combination of sampling methods and content analysis, applying both social feminist theory and the theory of the post-truth society; this research project aims to understand how the Republican presidential nominee used emotional language to gain voters support.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 INTRODUCTION <br />This dissertation project has been designed during the final weeks and immediate aftermath of the 2024 US Presidential election which has resulted in Republican leader Donald Trump being elected to serve a second term in office (he was first elected in 2016 however lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden and the Democratic Party). <br />Trump's landslide victory in the 2024 US election was certainly unexpected. The Republican presidential candidate has a strong negative in public image which is largely based on his criticisms regarding the economy (Ross et al., 2018) and immigration (Skinnell, 2018), as well as his currently extensive list of criminal convictions (Shahrasbi, 2020). However, the Trump campaign also had a very specific social media strategy focussed primarily on the platform X which involved publishing statements that played heavily on voters emotions, a technique very reminiscent of the post-truth society. Social media could have been the key deciding factor in the outcome of the election. It is also worth noting his choice to use the platform X because of the fact that it is run by Elon Musk who has now been selected to join the Trump administration to head the department of government efficiency.<br />The aim of this project is to evaluate and analyse the role that X played in the political campaigns that led up to the 2024 US presidential election. I intend to conduct this research for three reasons: the first being to provide a point of reference for future political campaign runners to demonstrate the impact that social media can have on public opinion; to increase public awareness of political campaign strategy to better equip them with the tools to form their own opinions and conclusions regarding political figures; and to illustrate how X differs from other platforms in regards to its role in political campaigns.</p>\n<p>4 LITERATURE REVIEW/ FIELD MAPPING/ METHODOLOGY <br />4.1 Introduction to US 2024 campaigns<br />The purpose of my literature was to review previous studies conducted into national election campaigns in order to identify research methods that best suited my aims and objectives. Through these papers, I also gained insight into relevant frameworks and theories I could then apply to my own content analysis. Topics covered by my chosen literature include: previous national elections, the role of social media and political campaigns, how social media has been used as a strategy for political and public campaigns. A selection of works also identified that focused more specifically on X (formally known as Twitter), the social media platform on which my research is being conducted, and it is unique use as a method of communication with voters by political figures. Noviani et al.&rsquo;s paper Political Strategies in a Digital Era: A Literature Review of Social Media Practices, provides a unique insight into how political strategy has adapted to the change in voters interaction habits which the later argues has increased with the rise of social media (Noviani et al., 2024).<br />4.2 Social media platforms and their relationship with political campaigns<br />4.2.1 How do politicians engage with social media?<br />Cinus et al. describes social media as a &ldquo;[&hellip;] vital arena for public discourse,&rdquo; (Noviani et al., 2024). The paper, titled Exposing Cross-Platform Coordinated Inauthentic Activity in the Run-Up to the 2024 U.S. Election, expands on this statement by further describing social media as \"&hellip;a platform where individuals and communities can converge to discuss political, social, and cultural issues.&rdquo;. This is where the concept of cross-platform coordination is then raised as one of the issues that has arisen as a result of politicians using social media as a campaign tool, something that Cinus et al.highlights as a persistent challenge for social media due to previous investigations being limited to individual platforms. Through a proposed &ldquo;advanced detection model,&rdquo; Cinus et al. revealed evidence of &ldquo;potential foreign interference,&rdquo; that spanned across the platforms X and Telegram. The paper provided my own research with greater depth because it highlighted not only a way in which social media is used by political figures but also a gap in previously conducted research.<br />Featured in the book Faking the News: What Rhetoric Can Teach Us About Donald J. Trump written by Ryan Skinnel; chapter 8 which is authored by Collin G. Brooke and titled How Trump #Broke/red the Internet presents social media as the current form of communication in American politics. Comparing the role it plays to that of the radio, network television, and cable television (Brooke, 2018). When talking about the changes in political communication happening in response to the rise in social media, Brooke states &ldquo;As we have moved into the 21st century, however, our modes of delivery have begun to shape not only the information we are exposed to but the processes themselves.&rdquo; (Brooke, 2018). The paper goes on to talk about how not only are the mediums via which politicians communicate changing, making several references to McLuhan&rsquo;s The Medium is the Message (McLuhan, 2008), but what politicians are choosing to communicate too. Brooke presents fake news, internet trends, and social media hashtags, as examples to accompany the theory. This argument provides another facet to my analysis and something to consider when examining and interpreting my data.<br />4.2.2 What is the influence of social media on public opinion and voting behaviour?<br />During his 2016 election campaign, Trump used social media as a platform on which to provide a community for his voters. In the paper Emotions and Political Narratives: Populism, Trump , and Trade, Amy Skonieczny points out how Trump presented himself as united with his voters on one team, united agaist the top 1% or in this particular example, the economy (Skonieczny, 2018). The populist tactics deployed by Trump were then able to &ldquo;[evoke] feelings of a certain type of &lsquo;we-ness&rsquo;.&rdquo;. It is arguably because he was able to bring his voters together in one space using social media that his methods were so effective. Because all of his supporters were gathered in one place, it could be argued that the common ideology presented by Trump and shared by his voters were bounced around the space to the extent that it was strengthened in a way. This is a prime example of how the nature of social media is changing the way in which voters receive and react to political ideology.<br />4.3 Different frameworks for analysis social media content<br />4.3.1 Socialist feminism<br />Socialist Feminism is relevant when studying political discourse taking place on social media platforms because of the reoccurring themes of extremist ideology (Graham, 2016) that is so prevalent in these online spaces. Barbara Ehenreich defines socialist feminism as a &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; of Marxism and Feminism (Ehrenreich, 1976). The article points out that &ldquo;[&hellip;] Marxism and feminism have an important thing in common: they are critical ways of looking at the world.&rdquo;. This allows for any pre-existing themes of social inequality to be highlighted, challenging norms and social structures that shape political discourse and provides a framework for statements found within social media data to be evaluated.<br />4.3.2 Postmodernist theory with post-truth society theory<br />Where social feminism focuses more on identifying the meaning of the context itself, postmodernism and more specifically post-truth society theory, addresses the underlying narrative behind the platform content. Although postmodernism is commonly regarded as a broad and notably undefined theoretical perspective, for the purpose of this work I will be drawing upon Lyotard&rsquo;s interpretation of the framework which focuses on the decline of grand narratives (Lyotard, 1979). This links to the theory of the post-truth society which emerged during Donald Trump&rsquo;s 2016 election campaign. The theory describes a political culture in which politics (public opinion and media narratives) have become almost entirely disconnected from policy (the substance of legislation). Skonieczny explains how the concept manifested itself within Trump&rsquo;s 2016 election campaign as &ldquo;[&hellip;] a wave of American populism [that] triggered emotional reactions to issues like trade and immigration,&rdquo; (Skonieczny, 2018). This observation directly supports my hypothesis regarding Trump&rsquo;s gaining of voters by gathering them all into one space, in this case X (formerly known as Twitter), and providing them with a common enemy, in turn giving them all a specified target to turn against. By applying Lyotard&rsquo;s defined version of the postmodern perspective and post-truth society theory to my data sample, I am able to identify any evidence of emotionally motivated narratives that may exist within Trump&rsquo;s campaign messages.<br />4.3.3 Summary of Frameworks<br />By applying both socialist feminist and post-truth theories to the results, the intention is to gain insight into two things: the narrative behind Trump&rsquo;s published content on X (formerly Twitter), and any obvious links between the rhetoric presented in Trump&rsquo;s Tweets and the voters that responded positively (and negatively) to it. The results are analysed using the theory of the post-truth society in order to identify any evidence of an existing narrative behind Trump&rsquo;s posts on the platform with the intention of developing an understanding regarding possible motives or intentions attached to the content. Socialist feminist theory is applied to the results to identify any possible demographics targeted by the campaign strategies demonstrated by Trump on the platform. By identifying those demographics, further insight can be gained into the common characteristics mentioned in my hypothesis as being exploited by Trump to unite his voters, beyond providing them a common enemy. Skonieczny concluded the aformentioned common enemy to be the economy (Skonieczny, 2018), applying the socialist feminist framework to the results allows for further insight to be gained in this regard and for the potential of an alternative enemy to be identified.</p>\n<p>5 RESEARCH QUESTION AND OBJECTIVES<br />RESEARCH QUESTION: What role did Donald Trump&rsquo;s use of X (formerly Twitter) play in the outcome of the 2024 election?<br />OBJECTIVE 1: To identify how Trump used keywords, language, ideological content and existing beliefs relating to traditional American values to engage with voters using X . These relate specifically to the topics of Immigration, Christianity, Diversity, Equality and Inclusion (DEI) and Reproductive Rights.<br />OBJECTIVE 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of exploiting people&rsquo;s emotions to gain support from voters by drawing attention to the language used in the tweets and the possible lack of factual evidence provided alongside the statements. <br />OBJECTIVE 3: To examine the language used in the comments responding to these tweets from both apparent supporters of Donald Trump and those who were apparently against his policies.</p>\n<p>6 RESEARCH METHODS, STUDY DESIGN AND ETHICS<br />This project adapts the research method process validated by Roderick Graham in the journal article titled Inter-ideological mingling: White extremist ideology entering the mainstream on Twitter (Graham, 2016). The data were collected using purposive sampling, selecting a total of twelve Tweets. Those Tweets consist of four themes, related to the &lsquo;common enemy&rsquo; hypothesis formed during the subsection 2.3.2 of the literature review. They are: Immigration, Christianity, DEI (diversity, equality, and inclusion), and Reproductive rights. For each theme, three Tweets posted by the @realDonaldTrump account (Retweets of posts originally posted by the other accounts were not included in the sampling) are selected for each theme. For each post, six comments are then selected: three that agreed with it, and three that disagreed with it. This results in a sample of 84 tweets in total, 12 posted by Donald Trump and 72 posted by other accounts on the platform as direct comments published in the comment sections of Trump's posts. The decision to include comments from accounts belonging to members of the public in the sampling process was strengthened following the approach suggested Noviani et al. (2024) who observes their increased role in the political process in a journal article titled Political Campaign Strategies in the Digital Age: A Literature Review of Social Media Practices. Platform content that challenged Trump&rsquo;s tweets was also included alongside that which supported it for evaluative purposes.<br />Once collected, the data is then arranged in a spreadsheet organized into columns. The first column contains each tweets caseID, enabling the data to be differentiated when it is imported into the data analysis software during the next step. The second column contains the theme under which the Trump Tweet was originally selected (immigration, Christianity, reproductive rights, or DEI). The next two columns contain the content of the Trump Tweet and the date it was published. Following the date column are four \"yes or no \"columns for the purpose of filtering the data based on whether or not the Trump Tweet meets each criterion. The criteria assigned to each of the four columns are: \"opposition actions\" &ndash; whether or not the Tweet contains any reference to any specific decisions made by or actions taken by the opposition party, which in this case is the Democratic Party; \"anti-Americans \"&ndash; whether or not the Tweet contains any reference to a specific person or group of people that Trump deems to not align with American values; \"for the people \"&ndash; whether the Tweet contains any reference to Trump acting with the belief that he's doing it for the good of the American people; and \"demonizing opposition\"&ndash; does the Tweet directly insult the Democratic Party or its members? After that are columns containing the comments that were sampled of which there were six selected from the comment section under each of the Tweets authored by Trump that were chosen. Each group of six comments consist of three comments that agree with the Tweet they were commenting on and three that disagree. The data pertaining to each comment is organized into columns titled &ldquo;comment username\", \"for against\"(Referring to the initial selection method which involved three comments that agreed and three that disagreed with each of Trump's Tweets), \"comment date \", and \"comment text \", followed by the same four \"yes or no\" columns containing the criteria used to filter the initial trump tweets, to filter the comments based on whether or not the text content of the comment aligned with each criteria. The final column contains any hashtags that feature within the comment, to keep them separate from the textual content of the comment for the purpose of being able to code the data for analysis in the next step.<br />6.1 Ethics<br />An ethics application was made through the university&rsquo;s decreed process which received full authorisation with no concerns or amendments.<br />The research methods used for this project are adapted from Roderick Graham&rsquo;s paper *Interideological Mingling: White Extremist Ideology Entering the Mainstream on Twitter* and are described in depth in the &ldquo;Research Methodology&rdquo; section. <br />In regard to using X (formerly Twitter) as the chosen source of primary data for this research, guidelines for researchers published on the University College London website state that upon sign up, users are clearly informed of the potential for their data to be used for research purposes, meaning that their consent for their data to be used in this project is given implicitly (Gold, 2020). The official guidelines provided by the Department for Education on the UK government website state as follows: &ldquo;As a user researcher, you can use social media to: [&hellip;] track search terms and analytics data relating to your research subject, identify the language and sentiment expressed by users&hellip;&rdquo; (UK Department for Education, 2023).<br />All data gathered from the comments under Trump&rsquo;s posts is presented anonymously in my thesis with no usernames attached to the comment contents. The data extracted from Trump&rsquo;s posts is not anonymous however as a political candidate posting from a verified public account (@realDonaldTrump), on a publicly accessible platform (X (formerly known as Twitter)), his consent for his account&rsquo;s data to be collected and used as part of my research is implicit. The fact that his tweets are frequently quoted and referenced by multiple media outlets (Kreis, 2017) further proves that use of his platform data for the purpose of my academic research is not an ethical violation.</p>\n<p>7 ANALYSIS/DISCUSSION OF DATA COLLECTED (MAIN BODY)<br />7.1 Organisation of sampled data<br />The spreadsheet used to organize and display the raw data included in the sample extracted from X was imported into a data analysis software called NVivo 14. In analyzing the textual content of the posts, the aim was to identify any keywords that featured in the discussions surrounding the four original themes, both for and against. By doing this, the intention was to identify any patterns in the way that each of the fourth themes are addressed and any popular ways of debating each theme.<br />This was achieved by first filtering the files containing the data pertaining to each theme to separate out the comments that were for and against Trump's original tweet. Then the column containing the textual contents of the comments was selected to be coded. A new code was then created that filtered the data in the selected column to show only the data in that column that was either for or against and pertaining to a single theme (the process was repeated in order to create individual sets of results for each of the four themes, both the data belonging to the &ldquo;for&rdquo; and \"against\" comments together as well as separate data sets showing only \"for\" and only \"against\" comment text content). Each set of results was then visualized in a word cloud featuring the one-hundred most frequent words found in the remaining textual data after the sample had been filtered by the code. Each word cloud was also set to be a minimum of three words long and include &ldquo;stemmed words&rdquo;.<br />7.2 Immigration</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Figure 1. Word clouds generated from responses to three X (formerly known as Twitter) posts from Donald Trump relating to Immigration. LEFT are words from posts supportive (for) of Trump and RIGHT are from posts against the original tweet (n = 9 cases).</p>\n<p>7.2.1 For immigration posts<br />The word cloud shown on the left in Figure 1 illustrates the most commonly occurring words in the comments included in the data sample that agree with the statement posted by Trump on X relating to the theme of immigration (Figure 1). According to the results of the coded content analysis of these comments, the two keywords that appear most frequently are &ldquo;border&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kamala&rdquo;, which both appear four times throughout the sample consisting of nine comments. &ldquo;America&rdquo;, &ldquo;illegals&rdquo; and &ldquo;Trump&rdquo;, are the next most common with all three keywords appearing a total of three times each across the nine comments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Figure 2 a &amp; b. Word tree featuring key term &lsquo;border&rsquo; and &lsquo;illegals&rsquo; from tweet comments for Trump&rsquo;s posts on immigration<br />Figure 2a features a word tree showing the contexts in which the keyword &ldquo;border&rdquo; is mentioned. The word tree states that the keyword most commonly appears in statements that described the nation&rsquo;s border as being &ldquo;open&rdquo;, criticizing the Democrats for the particular policy and frequently following the criticism with accusations of murder. A comment that demonstrates this observation particularly well reads: \"Democrats needs to start being charged with murder for their open border&rdquo;.<br />One of the next most frequently occurring keywords, according to the results is &ldquo;illegals&rdquo;, which appears three times in the nine comments analysed. The word tree featured in figure 2b helps show that the keyword is most commonly used as a derogatory term, referring to migrants entering the United States as a result of, according to these same comments, the Democrats &lsquo;open border&rsquo; policy. The word tree also illustrates a common belief held by many of the comments agreeing with Trump's tweets on the theme of immigration, that Trump will make America &ldquo;safe again&rdquo; by &ldquo;deporting illegals&rdquo; and &ldquo;closing the border&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>7.2.2 Against immigration posts<br /> <br />Figure 3 Word tree featuring key term &lsquo;&rsquo;fear&rsquo; from tweet comments against Trump&rsquo;s posts on immigration</p>\n<p>As shown by the word cloud in figure 3, the keyword most frequently mentioned in the comments included in the sample that disagree with Trump&rsquo;s tweets on the theme of immigration is &ldquo;fear&rdquo;. The word tree in figure 3 shows that the keyword often features as part of accusations made towards Trump of &ldquo;fear mongering&rdquo;. This ties closely to the hypothesis detailed in subsection 2.3.2 of the literature review regarding Trump&rsquo;s strategy of presenting the public with a &ldquo;common enemy&rdquo; to unite against. If Trump were able to create this &ldquo;common enemy&rdquo; then he would have the control over the narrative allowing him to present the already-united public with a solution involving voting for him in turn gaining large numbers of supporters in one go.<br />A second commonly occurring phrase within this selection of comments, shown by the word cloud is &ldquo;people&rdquo;. This is a result of many of the comments accusing Trump of targeting innocent minorities in order to use them as &ldquo;scapegoat[s]&rdquo; to quote a term used in one comment.<br />7.3 Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion (DEI)<br /> <br />Figure 4. Word clouds generated from responses to three X (formerly known as Twitter) posts from Donald Trump relating to Diversity, Equality and Inclusion (DEI). LEFT are words from posts supportive (for) of Trump and RIGHT are from posts against the original tweet (n = 9 cases).</p>\n<p>7.3.1 For DEI posts</p>\n<p>Figure 5a &amp; b. Word tree featuring key term &lsquo;wars&rsquo; and &lsquo;babies&rsquo; from tweet comments for Trump&rsquo;s posts on Diversity, Equality and Inclusion<br />One of the most common keywords according to the word cloud displaying the word frequency for this classification of comments (figure 5a) is &ldquo;wars&rdquo;. The word tree featured in figure 5a illustrates that the most common context in which this keyword appears is during claims that while there were wars that took place during Harris&rsquo;s term as vice-president, none took place during Trump&rsquo;s first term as president.<br />A second keyword that appears frequently in the sample of comments agreeing with Trump&rsquo;s tweets on the theme of DEI (figure 5b) included in the word cloud (figure 4) is &ldquo;babies&rdquo;. This is because of a seemingly common topic among these tweets which references Trump&rsquo;s ban on abortion during his first term as president, describing Harris as &ldquo;murdering babies&rdquo; (see the word tree in figure) during her term as vice-president and comparing her to Trump by saying that is something he didn&rsquo;t do.<br />7.3.2 Against DEI posts<br /> <br /> <br />Figure 6a &amp; b. Word tree featuring key term &lsquo;muslims&rsquo; and &lsquo;strong&rsquo; from tweet comments against Trump&rsquo;s posts on Diversity, Equality and Inclusion <br />As illustrated in the word cloud figure 4, one of the most frequently occurring keywords in the comments disagreeing with the three Trump tweets displayed in the figure was &ldquo;muslims&rdquo;. The word tree in figure 5a illustrates the primary reason for this is that many of the comments analysed for the word cloud contain reminders of previous actions taken by Trump that could be seen as Islamophobic, particularly focusing on a decision he made during his first term that they interpret as being an attempted &ldquo;muslim ban&rdquo;, one comment even goes as far as to accuse Trump of being in league with Netenyahu.<br />The same word cloud illustrates the keyword &ldquo;strong&rdquo; to also be one of the most used in the sample, mainly in response to Trump&rsquo;s claim in one of the tweets (figure 5b), claiming that he surrounds himself with &ldquo;the strongest of women&rdquo;. The word tree in figure 5b shows that this key word is most commonly featured in comments challenging the particular claim made by Trump, stating that he has &ldquo;never surrounded&rdquo; himself with strong women.<br />7.4 Christianity<br /> <br />Figure 7. Word clouds generated from responses to three X (formerly known as Twitter) posts from Donald Trump relating to Christianity. LEFT are words from posts supportive (for) of Trump and RIGHT are from posts against the original tweet (n = 9 cases).<br />&emsp;<br />7.4.1 For Christianity posts<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Figure 8 a, b &amp; c. Word tree featuring key term &lsquo;evil&rsquo;,&lsquo;religious&rsquo; and &lsquo;strong&rsquo; from tweet comments for Trump&rsquo;s posts on Christianity<br />The word cloud (figure 7) includes the specification made in both Trump&rsquo;s tweets and the comments agreeing with those tweets regarding the democrats losing the catholic vote. It also illustrates the shared idea that seems to span all comments agreeing with Trump&rsquo;s tweets on the theme of Christianity that the Democrats, but more specifically Harris, &ldquo;hates all Christians&rdquo;.<br />Linking to that shared idea, another keyword shown to be prevalent among the comments analysed is &ldquo;evil&rdquo;. More specifically, statements calling Harris herself &ldquo;evil&rdquo;, as is shown by the word tree in figure 8a.<br />Perhaps more notable is the inclusion of the words &ldquo;religious&rdquo; and &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;, which as illustrated by the word tree in figures 8b and 8c, often feature in the sample together. The word cloud (figure 7) paired with the individual word trees clearly show the belief shared by the sampled comments that agree with Trumps tweets (figure 7) that, if elected, Trump will achieve religious freedom for all American citizens.</p>\n<p><br />7.4.2 Against Christianity posts<br />The word cloud displayed in figure 8 highlights the commonality of several words across the comments sampled that disagree with Trump&rsquo;s tweets including &ldquo;catholic&rdquo;, &ldquo;convicted&rdquo;, &ldquo;vote&rdquo;, &ldquo;rapist&rdquo;, &ldquo;man&rdquo;, and &ldquo;church&rdquo;. The keyword &ldquo;vote&rdquo; features in both the word cloud representing the frequency of terms used in the comments sampled that disagreed with Trump&rsquo;s tweets (figure 8) and the word cloud regarding the comments that agreed with Trump&rsquo;s tweets. However the context in which the term &ldquo;vote&rdquo; features in the comments disagreeing with Trump&rsquo;s tweets is a direct contrast to the comments that agree. Whereas the comments agreeing with Trump&rsquo;s tweets echoed his belief that the Democrats had lost the Christian vote, many of the comments disagreeing with the original tweets directly challenge that belief; stating that, as Christians themselves &ndash; many of them being catholics, they would never vote for Trump because in their words he is a &ldquo;rapist&rdquo; and a &ldquo;racist&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>7.5 Reproductive rights<br /> <br /> <br />Figure 9. Word clouds generated from responses to an X (formerly known as Twitter) post from Donald Trump relating to Reproductive rights. LEFT are words from posts supportive (for) of Trump and RIGHT are from posts against the original tweet (n = 3 cases &ndash; reduced data set due to limited posts).<br />When searching for tweets published by Trump associated with the theme of reproductive rights, only one tweet was identified as relevant. As not to reduce the credibility of the research by including irrelevant data, the decision was made to keep the theme within the research for contrast and comparative purposes but only include that one tweet, with the six comments selected, in the set.<br />7.5.1 For reproductive rights<br />As shown by the term highlighted in the word cloud. (Figure 9), a reoccurring theme across the three comments that agreed with Trump&rsquo;s tweet is &ldquo;abortion&rdquo;. This term often appears in statements sharing the view that abortion should be a matter for state legislation rather than federal legislation. A second notable term included in the word cloud in figure 9 is &ldquo;ban&rdquo;. Any accusation of previous attempts by Trump to ban abortion are adamantly denied by all three comments, stating that anyone making these accusations &ldquo;is lying&rdquo;.<br />7.5.2 Against reproductive rights<br />As the word cloud in figure 9 highlights, both the terms &ldquo;woman&rdquo; and &ldquo;women&rdquo; feature heavily in the comments disagreeing with Trump&rsquo;s tweet related to the theme of reproductive rights. This highlights the focus of the selected comments on the role of women in the discussion on the matter, comments featuring the key term &ldquo;woman&rdquo; show multiple variations of the argument being made that a woman should have the power to decide whether or not she has an abortion and that no man has the right to decide for her.<br />Equally prominent is the inclusion of the terms &ldquo;roe&rdquo; and &ldquo;wade&rdquo;, representing the Supreme Court ruling named &ldquo;Roe vs Wade&rdquo; made in 1973 which decreed the right to an abortion constitutional and protected by the fourteenth amendment; a ruling that was famously overturned (another key term included in the same word cloud) during Trump&rsquo;s first term as President. The sampled comments to be challenging the statement made by Trump in his tweet that &ldquo;everyone knows [he] would not support a federal abortion ban&rdquo; by presenting the ruling&rsquo;s overturning that happened during his first term in office as evidence to disprove the statement.<br />7.6 Discussion and analysis of findings<br />The results obtained from the research process provide a detailed insight into the ways in which Trump uses key terms, language, and concepts associated with traditional American values to engage voters. A common feature of many of the tweets included in the sample is the referencing of immigrants using derogatory terms such as &ldquo;illegals&rdquo;. When comparing the contents of the sampled tweets posted by Trump, a common narrative becomes apparent which involves immigrants being used as what one comment described, when challenging one of Trump&rsquo;s tweets, &ldquo;scapegoats&rdquo;. The tweet in question recalls a visit made by Trump to Austin, Texas, to visit a grieving mother who&rsquo;s 12-year-old daughter had been murdered. Even though Trump doesn&rsquo;t include any specific details regarding the murderer, he does include the statement: &ldquo;&hellip;[the 12-year-old daughter] was murdered by illegal aliens let in under Kamala Harris&hellip;&rdquo;. Not only does the tweet manage to demonise an entire demographic by referring to the murderer using language that is both derogatory and unspecified; but it also demonises the leader of the opposition by blaming her for the murder. This observation supports the hypothesis formed at the beginning of the research (can be found in subsection 2.3.2Postmodernist theory with post-truth society theory featured in the literature review) because it demonstrates Trump creating a &lsquo;common enemy&rsquo;: immigrants through the use of derogatory language and accusations of murder, and Kamala Harris for which he blamed for letting the &ldquo;illegal aliens&rdquo; into the country. Furthermore, several other tweets included in the sample contain the same characteristics: referring to immigrants using derogatory, as well as accusatory, language and then making a statement of accusation towards Harris and the Democratic party of allowing these people into the country with their &lsquo;open border&rsquo; policy. <br />There&rsquo;s evidence of a populist rhetoric throughout the tweets posted by Trump&rsquo;s verified X account included in the sample. Not only do the tweets invoke an emotional response from voters through their use of inflammatory and demonising language aimed at anyone Trump perceives as &lsquo;the enemy&rsquo;, they create what Skonieczny describes as &ldquo;a sense of we-ness&rdquo; (Skonieczny, 2018).<br />Analysing the results obtained from the research through a social feminist frame would highlight the common pattern found in many of the comments sampled that disagreed with the statements made in Trump&rsquo;s tweets of directly challenging them, specifically challenging the way in which Trump presents immigrants as a threat to America. Applying post-truth theory to my results would draw attention to the existence of the unevidenced statements made by the tweets and more specifically, the emotional responses they generate from members of the public who comment in support of Trump.<br />&emsp;</p>\n<p>8 CONCLUSION :<br />8.1 Objective 1:<br />- Trump&rsquo;s tweets feature statements targeting and demonising immigrants which he then promises to get rid of if elected by deporting them and closing the border<br />- His tweets demonise the opposition by accusing them of not aligning with American values, maintaining a common theme of accusing democrats of not caring about the American people<br />- Presents a strong image of being &lsquo;for the people&rsquo;<br />- Includes reoccurring theme of &lsquo;restoring America to its former glory&rsquo;<br />8.2 Objective 2:<br />- Features several examples of politicising tragedies such as murder and blaming them on a demographic (immigrants) and then promising to provide solutions <br />- Describes Democratic abortion policies using negative emotional language and accuses Harris of &ldquo;demanding late term abortion&rdquo;<br />- Creates a narrative saying that the Democrats can&rsquo;t be trusted<br />8.3 Objective 3:<br />- A common theme among comments disagreeing with Trump of disproving his statements using his previous actions and decisions e.g. &ldquo;convicted felon&rdquo;, overturning roe vs wade<br />- Presents a theme among comments supporting Trump of accusing Harris of murder &ndash; in both the contexts of immigration and abortion<br />- Supporters echo his promises, stating that Trump is America&rsquo;s &lsquo;only hope&rsquo; because he will &ldquo;close the border&rdquo; and &ldquo;make America safe again&rdquo;</p>",

                    "text": "<p>ABSTRACT<br />This dissertation examines the effects of celebrity and influencer partnerships in the Nigerian alcohol industry with special reference to the partnership between Davido and Martell Cognac. Theories of audience reception (Hall, 1980), the culture industry (Adorno &amp; Horkheimer, 1944), parasocial interactions (Hills, 2016; Liu, 2023), and media ecology (McLuhan, 1964) are used in this study to show that global brands can tap into Afrobeat stardom and prompt complex, and sometimes controversial, audience responses. A qualitative discourse analysis of social media data from X (formerly Twitter) shows that the responses to the topic are multifaceted and include outright criticism (complaints that Davido has betrayed a dear musical heritage and is promoting a luxury that is unattainable) to laudatory reactions (approval of Davido as a successful entrepreneur and inspiration). In both cases, fans also often incorporate moral and socio-political issues and demand that celebrities should speak out against the political climate in Nigeria or support local social movements like #EndSARS .</p>\n<p>User comments are found to be active &lsquo;decoding&rsquo; of messages, where the latter are encoded by Martell as &lsquo;luxury meets Afrobeat pride&rsquo; but decoded by the audience in terms of socioeconomic, cultural, and ethical considerations. Criticisms are often made on the grounds of the cost of the cognac (Not for the poor), perceived moral impropriety (criticisms levelled at Davido&rsquo;s personal behaviour), and political obligations associated with Afrobeat (referencing Fela Kuti&rsquo;s activism) . On the other hand, positive posts proclaim Davido&rsquo;s rags-to-riches story and present him as a reference point for the fans who can relate to him through his endorsement deals. These divergent perspectives reveal the symbiotic and conflictual relationships between influencer activities, local fan cultures, and platform-driven dynamics (hashtags, algorithmic visibility).</p>\n<p>Through the analysis of Davido as both a traditional celebrity (Afrobeat superstar) and digital influencer (through his active social media presence), the study demonstrates the strength of parasocial intimacy in the formation of consumer attitudes. These bonds can enhance brand loyalty and overcome economic or moral concerns, but there are certain segments of the audience that are very critical. Furthermore, the data shows that linguistic features, specifically Nigerian Pidgin, are an integral part of fan discourse, with many posts that contain pointed remarks are always accompanied by an adjacent English translation in this dissertation in an attempt to capture the original meaning.</p>\n<p>Overall, this project contributes to the understanding of the complex interplay of culture, socioeconomics, brand messaging, and audience agency in the entertainment industry in Nigeria. As global alcohol brands such as Martell seek to associate their product with Afrobeat stars, they must contend with the varied economic backgrounds of fans and the cultural norms regarding celebrity activism. These findings have implications for the ethics and strategies of influencer media activities, especially in contexts where communal identity, socio-political activism, and religious sensitivities are at play. In this dissertation, the author recommends that future research should be extended beyond the borders of Nigeria to include diaspora communities and other African markets in the negotiation of brand alignments, cultural authenticity, and moral responsibility, a testament to the ongoing complexities of celebrity influence in a digitally networked world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 INTRODUCTION <br />Research in media and communication studies demonstrates growing interest in influencer advertising because digital platforms transform traditional celebrity endorsements into interactive personalized marketing approaches. Through their connection with social media's immediate nature, celebrities in African pop culture spaces evolve into artistic symbols who also function as accessible everyday influencers (Abidin &amp; Ots, 2016; Hills, 2016). The dual persona of Davido as an Afrobeat superstar and Martell Cognac endorser has sparked intense discussion among Nigerian audiences throughout X and other social media platforms.</p>\n<p>The research on celebrity stardom and branding has already been explored, but the impact of sociopolitical factors alongside religious and moral expectations, together with localized linguistic expressions (Nigerian Pidgin) on the success of endorsements remains an underexamined area (Abah, 2009; Onanuga, 2024). This project aims to fill the research gap through an analysis of how Davido's endorsement functions with economic inequalities and culturally rooted activism and fan-led interpretive practices. Users participate in an active process of interpreting brand narratives beyond the basic &ldquo;persuasion&rdquo; model according to this research (Hall, 1980).</p>\n<p>The research examines how well the campaign aligns with Afrobeat traditions that have always emphasized social protest and political commentary alongside grassroots community development (Lateef, 2024). Audience members who invoke Fela Kuti&rsquo;s legacy will likely criticise Davido for choosing profit over activism, according to their perspective. The present conflict shows how modern Afrobeat celebrities must balance their public duties to social and political conversation when they engage with multinational endorsement promotions. The dissertation uses qualitative discourse analysis to study user-generated posts while addressing these issues. The research presents Pidgin comments in their original version, which immediately follows English translations to maintain cultural authenticity. Through analyzing fan-generated content about these brands, the research project demonstrates how users integrate moral statements and comedic praise alongside direct socio-political appeals into brand-related conversations while redefining global marketing approaches. The research builds upon African media studies scholarship by analyzing celebrity endorsements through the lens of local cultural elements and moral standards, and fan engagement practices.</p>\n<p>2 LITERATURE REVIEW/ FIELD MAPPING/ METHODOLOGY <br />The practice of influencer activities developed through the combination of celebrity fame with social media functionality and networked audience interactions (Abidin &amp; Ots, 2016). The conventional focus of media studies involved using well-known celebrities to build trust for consumer promotions through television and print, and radio platforms. Modern digital marketing exceeds traditional celebrity endorsements because it leverages the perceived authenticity that emerges from regular social media engagement between influencers and their audience members (Hills, 2016; Liu, 2023). The distinction between celebrities who earn fame through their work and influencers who build their fame through online activities becomes indistinct in current times. The Davido&ndash;Martell partnership demonstrates how artists now serve as social media brand representatives, which enables them to modify brand stories instantly.<br />2.1 Media and Cultural Frameworks<br />2.1.1 Audience Theory (Hall, 1980)<br />Stuart Hall's Encoding/Decoding model explains that media producers embed specific meanings in their content, which audiences decode differently based on their cultural identity and life experiences, and environmental factors. The brand encodes a message about &ldquo;luxury meets Afrobeat pride,&rdquo; which links Davido's star image to Martell Cognac. Social media users who watched Davido promote Martell Cognac displayed a wide range of interpretations. Fans who prefer a particular interpretation welcome the partnership as a representation of achievement and luxury, yet others evaluate Davido's accomplishments while expressing doubts about brand price or moral issues while suggesting he should support less fortunate fans. The endorsement faces oppositional readings from critical viewers who reject its commodification of cultural icons, and some individuals reference Fela Kuti to evaluate the cultural value of these endorsements or question Davido's moral character. The diverse fan responses demonstrate how celebrity power intersects with branding while influencing public perception.<br />Fans who follow Martell's posts about Davido use them as indirect jabs at Wizkid (rival celebrity) during an ongoing feud, according to audience patterns described by Hall. Fans interpret the brand's timing and enthusiastic tone as opposing the standing of the opposing star through an oppositional reading as defined by Hall's framework. Fans use Martell's &ldquo;encoded&rdquo; congratulatory message for Davido to promote their favorite artist's success while fueling their rivalries between stars, thus demonstrating how audiences modify intended communications.<br />2.1.2 Culture Industry (Adorno &amp; Horkheimer, 1944)<br />The mass production of cultural products, including advertisements, serves, according to Adorno and Horkheimer, to create widespread consumer compliance. The personalized influencer activities represent a commodified version of brand ideology despite their more individualized approach. When a popular musician such as Davido promotes a premium drink, his Afrobeat legacy transforms into an elegant blend of luxury and achievement, thus potentially eliminating its core activist or grassroots elements. Critics brought forward the accusation that Davido utilized the late Fela Kuti to market his product, while others noticed the appropriation of cultural heritage for commercial profit. The &ldquo;culture industry&rdquo; concept shows how Fela's reputation as an activist loses meaning when commercial campaigns reduce his legacy to mere marketing purposes. Fans who call Davido a &ldquo;Fake Artist&rdquo; because he links Fela to drinking alcohol demonstrate audience resistance toward the commercialization of cultural icons.<br />2.1.3 Parasocial Interactions<br />Parasocial theories surpass traditional celebrity endorsements since they focus on building intimacy through ongoing social media interactions between stars and their audience (Hills, 2016; Liu, 2023). Through his active online presence, Davido builds close relationships with his fans, mostly consisting of Nigerian youth and diaspora audience members, by sharing various content types, including behind-the-scenes footage and casual updates. The fake closeness between followers and performers enables endorsed products to gain greater impact from the artist's endorsement. Some fans place greater faith in Davido's personal recommendations rather than standard advertising, which leads them to view Martell as a part of his own brand. The analysis reveals that enthusiastic fans both praise Davido's endorsement and express their commitment to drinking Martell until they reach full capacity, as seen in Fig. 29. Parasocial bonds create intensified consumer excitement through amplified fan loyalty. Through social media communication, fans develop a sense of closeness with Davido, which makes them view him as someone they can approach because they want to replicate his lifestyle.<br />2.1.4 Media Ecology (McLuhan, 1964)<br />Through media ecology, platforms such as Instagram, X, TikTok, etc. operate as environments that influence how users connect with content. Social media platforms deliver both fast and extensive reach, which allows a solitary endorsement to transform into a widespread cultural conversation. The combination of Martell's official posts and Davido's personal accounts and fan retweets leads to the solid establishment of the product in public awareness, even though audience members may interpret it either positively or negatively (Nygren, 2019). Hashtags such as #BeTheStandOutSwift and #MartellxDavido helped to quickly distribute content throughout the platform. The continuous stream of brand impressions on the platform takes the form of likes and shares, and retweets until users interrupt it with their short videos and memes about Davido's campaign. Modern digital culture demonstrates how the medium functions as the actual message through its ecological platform mechanisms, which both strengthen and misshape brand communications.<br />2.2 Combining Theories in an African Pop-Culture Context<br />These frameworks converge in Nigeria&rsquo;s Afrobeat scene, where Hall&rsquo;s active decoding appears when local fans refuse to accept Davido&rsquo;s marketing messages; Adorno&rsquo;s warnings about commodification appear in criticisms of using revered cultural icons for alcohol promotions; parasocial interactions flourish as fans hail Davido on social media. Each theoretical lens highlights a different dimension of influencer activities and how brand images, celebrity star power, and audience agency are connected.<br />2.3 Field Mapping: Davido and Martell in Context<br />Influencer activity studies in African contexts emphasize the significance of local linguistic and cultural markers, including Nigerian Pidgin and Afrobeat&rsquo;s activist legacy (Abah, 2009). It has been mentioned that Davido has a huge audience (young adults, diaspora communities, and pop enthusiasts) that shows the multifaceted nature of contemporary celebrity status. Thus, Martell&rsquo;s strategy was to try to merge its centuries-old cognac heritage with youth-oriented authenticity, a balancing act that can quickly cause an uproar on social media (Noel et al., 2018). Some followers referred to other social or political triggers like #EndSARS and #EdoDecides2024 , demanding that Davido speak out or support grassroots causes. Field mapping shows that in Nigeria, celebrity status implies moral leadership, particularly for those who are rooted in Afrobeat traditions of activism (Lateef, 2024). It is thus impossible to view an influencer endorsement as purely commercial; audiences hold the celebrity accountable for his or her past in terms of social justice and community upliftment.<br />2.4 Methodological Approach<br />Based on the prior research, this project employs a qualitative methodology that incorporates discourse analysis, thematic coding, and semiotic interpretation in order to analyze the cultural and social dynamics of Davido&rsquo;s endorsement of Martell Cognac. Data collection focuses on a purposive sample (using non-probability sampling techniques relevant to the objectives) involving posts from social media under the campaign-related hashtags mentioned in section 4.1, as well as user-generated commentary that included linguistic markers such as Nigerian Pidgin and Afrobeat references. Through discourse analysis, the study examines the ways in which cultural meanings are made around Davido&rsquo;s persona, Afrobeat heritage, moral expectations, and drinking. Thematic coding categorizes user reactions to determine how these interpretations align or conflict with the brand&rsquo;s intended messages, drawing on Hall&rsquo;s encoding/decoding model and Wren-Lewis&rsquo;s (1983) frameworks. Additionally, semiotic analysis evaluates visual and textual cues in official brand content, including luxury imagery and lifestyle, that symbolically position Martell as both aspirational and culturally relevant. Ethical considerations mean that only publicly available data is analyzed, and user anonymity is maintained even though usernames are visible on social media. The study is contextually grounded in Nigeria and its diaspora, as Davido has his main fan base there, and the local cultural references are crucial to the campaign. Given that many of the comments are in Nigerian Pidgin, the methodology must include careful translation into English to capture the nuances of sarcasm, moral reproach, or flattery. For example, &ldquo;You no get influence jor&rdquo; at the same time undermines Davido&rsquo;s stardom and criticizes alcohol distribution, which requires local contextual knowledge to decode these multiple meanings. In this paper, the project seeks to investigate influencer media activities in Nigeria&rsquo;s consumer behaviour leading to the alcohol industry, using a combination of diverse theoretical strands and methodological tools to demonstrate how brand messaging, celebrity identity, fan culture, and local linguistic practices intersect in one campaign.<br />3 RESEARCH QUESTIONS, AIMS, AND OBJECTIVES<br />Primary Research Question<br />How do celebrity/influencer endorsements, particularly Davido&rsquo;s partnership with Martell Cognac, shape consumer perceptions and engagement in the Nigerian alcohol market?<br />Secondary Questions<br />1. In what ways do socio-economic disparities and moral or religious values intersect with consumers&rsquo; interpretations of Davido&rsquo;s endorsement of Martell?<br />2. How do Nigerian Pidgin and local cultural references (e.g., Afrobeat&rsquo;s legacy) inform audience discussions, either endorsing or opposing influencer campaigns?<br />3. To what extent do parasocial relationships amplify the persuasiveness of influencer marketing in the alcohol sector?</p>\n<p><br />Aims<br />1. To critically assess the complex ways audiences decode influencer-driven alcohol activities on social media.<br />2. To identify how cultural identity, moral/religious expectations, and social class shape responses to celebrity endorsements.<br />3. To explore parasocial dimensions in the uptake or rejection of luxury products in emerging markets.<br />Objectives<br />1. Gather and analyze social media content (posts, comments, user interactions) involving Davido&rsquo;s Martell campaign over a defined period.<br />2. Categorize themes (criticism, praise, sociopolitical commentary) to reveal underlying audience sentiments and interpretive strategies.<br />3. Situate these findings within existing academic frameworks (audience theory, cultural studies, parasocial relationships) to contribute to broader influencer marketing debates.</p>\n<p>4 RESEARCH METHODS/ RESEARCH DESIGN AND OUTLINE/ CASE STUDY<br />4.1 Data Collection and Analysis<br />A purposive sampling strategy will select relevant posts and discussions from X under these hashtags #MartellxDavido, #BeTheStandOutSwift, and #MartellBlueSwift within the year 2024 because the campaigns are still at their peak. This approach means that the data is only on user reactions and messages related to Davido&rsquo;s endorsement. Thematic and Discourse Analysis will involve a close reading of user-generated content to identify patterns that can be coded under the following categories: Criticisms: Criticisms of inauthenticity, unavailability of the product, cultural appropriation, and moral/religious concerns. Praise: expressions of loyalty to the brand, admiration for the success of Davido, or even inspiration from him, and Sociopolitical Commentary: protest references to the End SARS movement and other civic matters, and complaints that Davido is &ldquo;not doing enough&rdquo; for the community. Such categorization of content will enable the analysis to link user sentiments to other socio-cultural factors. Also, the linguistic features (such as Pidgin) and how meaning is altered in translation will be taken into consideration.<br />4.2 Case Study Rationale<br />The decision to concentrate on the Martell Cognac&rsquo;s collaboration with Davido can be explained by both theoretical and practical reasons. This case presents an interesting intersection of factors that help to highlight the intricacies of influencer activities in the context of highly fluid African pop culture.<br />Davido&rsquo;s Hybrid Celebrity/Influencer Status<br />Davido became a popular name in the Afrobeat industry and gained a huge following at home and abroad. This musical background first positions him as a typical celebrity who is famous for his art. At the same time, Davido&rsquo;s consistent, on-the-spot presence on platforms like Instagram, X, TikTok, Snapchat, etc., makes him an influencer as well. His frequent posts, behind-the-scenes clips, and direct interaction with his fans help develop parasocial relationships (Hills, 2016; Liu, 2023), which can increase the impact of his commercials. The fact that Davido embodies both celebrity and influencer personas makes him an ideal subject for the study of how traditional fame intersects with the interactive dynamics of online fan culture.</p>\n<p>Martell&rsquo;s Global Brand Legacy vs. Local Relevance<br />Martell Cognac has its roots in centuries and has a good name across the globe in the premium and luxury segments. Working with a young Nigerian Afrobeat artist means that the brand wants to get into the young and vibrant market. The partnership with Davido is a clear example of how multinational corporations adapt their strategies to suit local markets by repositioning French luxury through Nigerian cultural symbols such as music, social gatherings, and language (Nigerian Pidgin). Examining Martell&rsquo;s strategy makes it possible to determine how international alcohol brands handle moral, cultural, and socio-political concerns in African markets, where issues of youth drinking, income inequality, and religious issues are always mentioned (Bhana, 2008; Noel et al., 2018).<br />Conflicts Between Luxury Branding and Socioeconomic Realities<br />The analysis reveals that many fans are critical of the endorsement in terms of accessibility. As Martell is a costly brand, there are many people who cannot complain about insensitive promotional campaigns in a country with a wide gap in income stability. Some of the audience members are against the idea of promoting alcohol consumption, given that some societies or cultures may be against it. Furthermore, allusions to Davido&rsquo;s individual problems (such as the perception of him as a cheat discussed in section 5.1.4, his perceived inactivity during the social movements discussed in section 5.3) point to the fact that moral judgments can easily get intertwined with brand assessment. This case allows researchers to observe how aspirational campaigns work with local criticism to show that endorsement is not always a welcome concept but is rather a process that is negotiated by the audience (Hall, 1980).<br />Afrobeat Legacy and Sociopolitical Expectations<br />Afrobeat has a tradition of political expression and social protest (e.g., Fela Kuti&rsquo;s activism). Some fans expect Davido, a major Afrobeat star, to continue being a voice for civic issues like #EndSARS or poverty alleviation, rather than only marketing premium goods. There is a visible conflict between the political activism of Afrobeat as a genre and the commercialism of the entertainment industry. Criticisms that suggest that Davido is using Fela to sell cognac are reflective of the fear of cultural imperialism (Adorno &amp; Horkheimer, 1944). This tension makes it possible to study the use of celebrity endorsements in cultural environments where fans expect more from their icons. It also points to the fact that an artist&rsquo;s past and his/her political involvement can shape how fans receive marketing messages.<br />Bridging Practical and Scholarly Gaps<br />To effectively use media communications, brands operating within alcohol-regulated sectors need to understand the specific local cultural practices and political climate, as well as societal moral standards, when choosing their influencer partners. African pop-culture contexts receive limited research attention about celebrity endorsements, even though they combine local languages with socio-economic differences and culturally based activism (Abah, 2009; Onanuga, 2024). This case provides original findings about influencer marketing campaigns generating conflicting interpretations that link marketing research to critical media communications and cultural studies.<br />Summary of Case Study Value<br />This case uses Davido's endorsement of Martell Cognac to demonstrate the convergence of global branding with local cultural expression while showing how audiences negotiate brand meaning under moral scrutiny. The success of an influencer in emerging markets relies on their ability to make brand narratives both impactful and ethical for diverse audience segments, rather than solely focusing on visibility or star power. A thorough examination of one prominent partnership reveals changes happening in media communications and celebrity culture as well as digital marketing and participatory media throughout sub-Saharan Africa and globally.<br />4.3 Research Outline<br />The methodological approach includes multiple consecutive steps. The first requirement of sampling &amp; identification demands the collection of posts from Martell's and Davido&rsquo;s verified accounts throughout a set time period. The following step includes basic English translation of Nigerian Pidgin remarks for data cleaning and organization purposes to detect sarcasm and moral reproach, and comedic flattery. The core analysis requires coding and thematic grouping through qualitative research principles, with manual coding to organize the collected posts into emergent themes. The interpretation phase will connect the coded findings to the study's conceptual frameworks about audience theory and culture industry, and parasocial relationships by analyzing how the brand's encoded messages interact with the local audience's decoding processes.<br />4.4 Ethical Considerations &amp; Case Study Boundaries<br />The study maintains user privacy through the analysis of publicly available comments but acknowledges sampling limitations because the results will show perspectives typically from social media users who might not represent the whole population, especially older or less digitally connected individuals.<br />5 ANALYSIS/DISCUSSION OF DATA COLLECTED (MAIN BODY)<br />5.1 Criticism<br />The criticisms surrounding the Martell x Davido partnership, as observed on X (Twitter), are extensive, revealing audience contestation over issues of campaign (in)effectiveness and authenticity, socioeconomic relevance, cultural appropriation, and the brand's navigation of external celebrity dynamics.<br />5.1.1 (In)Effectiveness and Authenticity<br />Some users directly questioned the campaign's impact, suggesting the product hadn't achieved widespread circulation despite the high-profile endorsement <br />Fig 01 &ldquo;Drink wey no reach my side. You no get influence jor.&rdquo; - (The drink has not gotten to me hence, your influence is not substantial).<br />This brief statement plays with Nigerian Pidgin to imply that despite Davido&rsquo;s promotional efforts, the product (Martell) has not reached local consumers effectively. By stating &ldquo;You no get influence,&rdquo; the commenter suggests that Davido&rsquo;s endorsement feels inconsequential or irrelevant for everyday Nigerians who have not physically encountered Martell in their communities. According to Stuart Hall&rsquo;s (1980) Encoding/Decoding model, while Martell encodes the message of status and broad availability, some audience members decode it through their material reality where distribution gaps or high costs undermine the claim that Davido&rsquo;s endorsement matters to them. Wren-Lewis (1983) further elaborates on the complexities of decoding, noting that audiences actively interpret messages based on their own social positions and experiences, which can lead to readings that challenge the dominant encoded meaning, as seen here where lived experience contradicts the campaign's implicit claims of widespread influence. <br /> <br />Fig 02 &ldquo;You just dey faaji we dey on trench, show your die hard fans love bro.&rdquo; (You are just there; showing off, when your die-hard fans are in a bad situation, it will be good to give us something like money).<br />&ldquo;Faaji&rdquo; (enjoyment or partying) and &ldquo;we dey on trench&rdquo; (we are struggling) contrasts Davido&rsquo;s public revelry with fans&rsquo; poverty or hardship. This directly questions the authenticity of Davido&rsquo;s &ldquo;influence&rdquo;: if he is truly an ambassador for the people, why is he not uplifting fans&rsquo; conditions alongside promoting Martell? This reiterates that some audience members decode celebrity endorsements as obligations to offer tangible help or resources an interpretation that extends beyond simply selling a product (Hall, 1980).<br /> <br />Fig 03 &ldquo;How many shares do you have in Martell?&rdquo;<br />This user&rsquo;s query calls attention to Davido&rsquo;s perceived over-investment in pushing Martell, questioning whether he is more than just a paid ambassador. If Davido does not truly own stakes in Martell, the endorsement might appear as a purely transactional relationship another challenge to authenticity. Groszman (2020) notes that authenticity often underpins an influencer&rsquo;s success; if fans sense that an endorsement is purely financial with little personal investment, they may dismiss it. Likewise, Abidin &amp; Ots (2016) emphasize that influencers constantly negotiate authenticity; when endorsements appear driven solely by financial gain rather than genuine belief or personal investment, audiences may become unconvinced and dismiss the message, viewing the relationship as inauthentic. <br /> <br />Fig 04 &ldquo;Small achievement, U dun dey get rubbish pride.&rdquo; (You have achieved something with Martell, which is small; that is why you are now being prideful).<br />This user insinuates that Davido&rsquo;s achievement with Martell is not substantial enough to warrant the &ldquo;pride&rdquo; he displays by associating himself with a luxury cognac. It portrays the mismatch between the star&rsquo;s self-presentation and fan perceptions of genuine success. In line with Lateef&rsquo;s (2024) view of celebrity culture in Nigeria, fans expect humility and social responsibility from local celebs; perceived arrogance can alienate followers who once saw Davido as a relatable figure.<br /> <br />Fig 05 &ldquo;Everybody don Dey use fela now o. People wey Fela na their mentor and real inspiration nor use fela sell drink ooo. FAKE ARTIST FAKE FANBASE..&rdquo; (Everybody is now using Fela. The main people who have been mentored and inspired by Fela did not use Fela to sell alcohol. Fake artist, fake fanbase).<br />This pointed critique accuses Davido through his partnership with Martell of commodifying the legacy of the late Fela Kuti, a figure celebrated for Pan-Africanism and political activism (I will talk about this more later, but in a nutshell, Davido is not political, but he does participate in market-oriented consumerism and sponsorship, unlike Fela Kuti) rather than commercial endorsements or alcohol promotions. The post suggests that appropriating Fela&rsquo;s cultural and revolutionary image for profit undermines his core values and disrespects the significance his work holds for many Nigerians. This aligns with broader concerns about the &ldquo;commodification of culture,&rdquo; a process in which potent symbols or historical icons are diluted when used in commercial contexts (Adorno and Horkheimer, 1944). Audiences respect Fela Kuti as an icon of political resistance and social critique and thus interpret Martell&rsquo;s strategy as opportunistic rather than a genuine homage. Abah (2009) similarly discusses how Nigerian popular culture can be adapted in ways that either celebrate or trivialize significant cultural forms. Meanwhile, Wright (2015), drawing on Hall&rsquo;s ideas, underscores the importance of critically examining how Black cultural figures are represented, misrepresented, or co-opted by globalized media industries. Against this backdrop, many audience members decode the Martell/Davido collaboration as an exploitative partnership, stripping Fela&rsquo;s legacy of its activist essence for commercial gain and clashing with the very ethos he stood for. On the other hand, these critiques reveal that significant segments of the public are far from passive recipients of celebrity endorsements. Audiences rigorously question the authenticity and motives behind such campaigns, scrutinizing whether the artists and brands involved align with deeper historical, cultural, and socio-economic realities. Failure to meet these standards triggers accusations of inauthenticity and &ldquo;fake&rdquo; fanbases (Abidin, 2018). In this way, the debate over Davido&rsquo;s Martell campaign demonstrates how consumers actively navigate, interpret, and sometimes reject celebrity-driven marketing when it fails to honour the cultural integrity of cherished icons like Fela Kuti.<br />5.1.2 Class Divide vs Reality<br />These comments reflect a disconnect between the aspirational branding of Martell and the lived realities of Davido&rsquo;s fanbase, many of whom perceive the product as unattainable. Audience theory underscores that consumers actively decode messages based on their socio-economic context (Hall, 1980). Here, the aspirational narrative encoded by Martell is reinterpreted by some fans as separating or superior. <br /> <br />Fig 06 &ldquo;Hungry Dey meet your fans boss, make we first chop before we shayo abeg.&rdquo; (Boss, your fans are hungry; let us eat food first before we drink alcohol).<br />&ldquo;Make we first chop&rdquo; (meaning &ldquo;let&rsquo;s eat first&rdquo;) highlights that many fans prioritise food security over luxury cognac. This frames the Martell campaign as tone deaf to local socio-economic realities. The suggestion that &ldquo;hungry dey meet your fans&rdquo; underscores the dissonance between Davido&rsquo;s lavish, high-profile promotions and the on-ground financial struggles of some followers. From Adorno and Horkheimer's (1944) perspective on the culture industry, the endorsement commodifies a high-end lifestyle that may not resonate with audiences who lack disposable income for premium alcohol. Similarly, this aligns with critiques of celebrity culture where lifestyles appear unrelatable or insensitive to broader societal struggles (Lateef, 2024). <br /> <br />Fig 07 &ldquo;Them drop this drink for the chair I be sidan for club, I just know sey na big man drink, see as I stand comot, Martel no be for shoe sellers&rdquo; (This drink was placed where I sat in a club, I knew I could not afford it, I quickly left there, Martel is not for people who make a living selling shoes),<br /> <br />Fig 08<br /> <br />Fig 09 \"Where poor man wan see money buy Martel?\" (People who can barely make a living where will they see money to buy anything other than food, talk more of a drink like Martel?).<br />The selected posts highlight a tension between Martell's luxury positioning and the socioeconomic realities faced by parts of Davido's fan base. Comments in Fig. 07, 08, and 09 articulate a critique of conspicuous consumption. They suggest that Davido's promotion of an expensive product feels out of touch or even \"prideful&rdquo; when basic needs are unmet for some fans. This aligns with critiques of celebrity culture where lifestyles appear unrelatable or insensitive to broader societal struggles (Lateef, 2024). Shaban (2024) explores how digitalization can amplify cultural production and exchange yet also exacerbate inequalities when global or &ldquo;aspirational&rdquo; brands fail to resonate with local purchasing power. Meanwhile, Caldwell (2024) highlights the spectacle and illusion embedded in consumer culture, warning that celebrity endorsements can mask socio-economic realities with simulated ideals. This resonates with Adorno and Horkheimer&rsquo;s (1944) notion of the culture industry as creating deceptive consumption fantasies. In Nigeria&rsquo;s popular culture scene, Abah (2009) observes how &ldquo;social change&rdquo; meets friction when local audiences see media portrayals that glorify unattainable lifestyles. These tension-filled critiques underscore how fans decode brand narratives as divisive rather than empowering (Hall, 1980; Wren-Lewis, 1983). By promoting a high-end cognac inaccessible to many, Davido appears prideful or detached from his fan base, thus undermining any claim to grassroots representation (Lateef, 2024).<br />5.1.3 Celebrity Feud and Brand Timing<br />The ongoing rivalry between Davido and Wizkid significantly colored the reception of Martell's posts. Users interpreted Martell's campaign timing, particularly posts celebrating Davido's influence, as insensitive or provocative, given the public feud. <br /> <br />Fig 10 \"Na, all your winning dey give Wizkid depression\" (Since Davido has been winning a lot lately, it could be a reason for Wizkid&rsquo;s depression).<br /> <br />Fig 11 \"This one go pain Wizkid\" (Davido&rsquo;s collaboration with Martel will definitely hurt Wizkid) and &ldquo;Wizkid nightmare&rdquo;<br /> <br />Fig 12 &ldquo;Martel you do this na this time you supposed post? &hellip; don&rsquo;t let Wizkid die of depression.&rdquo; (Martel, what have you done? Is this the time you are supposed to post? Please don&rsquo;t let Wizkid die of depression).<br /> <br />Fig 13 &ldquo;Nah now I see why Wizkid wan die&rdquo; (Now I know the reason why Wizkid is extremely angry, he may wish to be dead). <br />Fig 14 &ldquo;Na now I know why Wizkid dey vex.&rdquo; (Now I know the reason why Wizkid is angry).<br /> <br />Fig 15<br /> <br />Fig 16 &ldquo;Na brands dey fight for Davido&hellip;na now I understand that wizmidget pain&rdquo; (More brands are competing to sign Davido; now I understand why that dwarf Wizkid is in anguish).<br />Users frequently interpret Martell&rsquo;s celebratory posts featuring Davido as provocations aimed at stoking the longstanding Davido-Wizkid feud. Comments from Fig. 10 to 14 point to a belief that the brand&rsquo;s timing is deliberate and potentially malicious, while remarks seen in Fig. 15 reinforce perceptions that Martell is capitalizing on fan hostilities. Similarly, the statement in Fig. 16 underscores how audiences see Martell&rsquo;s involvement as aggravating the conflict. This brand entanglement in fan wars reflects the ways in which social media controversies can become valuable currency, driving visibility and engagement. Groszman (2020) notes that platform algorithms often amplify conflict, rewarding posts with heightened virality when they spark heated reactions. Ugor (2009), examining Nigerian popular culture, illustrates how small media channels provide fertile ground for youth to negotiate identity within star rivalries. In this context, Martell&rsquo;s posts are not viewed in isolation; rather, they are decoded through the lens of the Davido-Wizkid clash and the larger socio-cultural backdrop of Nigerian pop-culture fandom. Hall&rsquo;s (1980) encoding/decoding model and subsequent work by Wren-Lewis (1983) demonstrate that an audience&rsquo;s social knowledge, biases, and emotional investments shape how they interpret brand communications. <br /> <br />Fig 17 &ldquo;Aaahhh Martell all this while una no Post na now wey street dey hurt for the Liza una come Post una wan make him die ni? una wan make heart attack injury am?&rdquo; (Martell, all this while you did not post, now that there is a feud going on, you have posted, do you want Wizkid to die? Do you want him to have a heart attack?). <br />What might be a straightforward brand announcement becomes, in the eyes of Davido and Wizkid fans, a pointed jab. By referencing &ldquo;heart attack,&rdquo; the user exaggerates potential distress but underscores a real concern: that the brand&rsquo;s marketing could be seen as opportunistic exploitation of fan wars for exposure. These reactions resonate with audience theories that see social media users as active participants who read deeper motives behind corporate posts (Hall, 1980). It also aligns with Abidin and Ots&rsquo;s (2016) discussion of how digital media intensifies &ldquo;attention economies,&rdquo; where every post can be reframed or hijacked to serve a broader conflict narrative. Ultimately, Martell&rsquo;s timing is understood as opportunistic or insensitive, feeding into the ongoing star rivalry to garner viral traction and fan engagement. <br />5.1.4 Moral/Religious Grounds and Personal Conduct<br /> <br />Fig 18 &ldquo;You dey encourage us to drink alcohol? You no be good influence sha.&rdquo; (You are in reality, encouraging us to drink alcohol! You truly are not a good influence obviously).<br /> <br />Fig 19 &ldquo;Na true say you dey cheat on your wife? Ehn obiyo.&rdquo; (Is it true that you are cheating on your wife? yea Obiyo (nickname).<br /> <br />Fig 20 &ldquo;You be very mumu and ungrateful husband&hellip; they will do all this thing to your sisters too&hellip; Amen.&rdquo; (You are a senseless and ungrateful husband&hellip;).<br /> <br />Fig 21<br /> <br />Fig 22 &ldquo;Boss I hear say you Dey kneel to beg woman to allow you put your preek??&rdquo; (Boss I heard you usually kneel down to beg a woman to allow you sleep with her).<br /> <br />Fig 23<br />Audience critiques of Davido&rsquo;s ambassador role for Martell often center on moral or religious objections, as seen in Fig. 18; such posts condemn him for promoting alcohol consumption in a cultural context where conservative or faith-based views frown upon drinking (Lateef, 2024). Users thereby position celebrities like Davido as role models who ought to uphold community standards, highlighting an expectation that influencer culture must exhibit moral leadership (Langmia &amp; Tyree, 2017).<br />Additional criticisms target his alleged personal misconduct and how it undermines his brand affiliations. Fig. 19 combines outrage over rumoured infidelity with disdain for his status as a supposedly ethical product endorser. This resonates with Adorno and Horkheimer&rsquo;s (1944) argument that the culture industry commodifies every aspect of celebrity life, rendering even personal scandals part of the celebrity &ldquo;product.&rdquo; Similarly, Fig. 20 intensifies this condemnation by invoking a curse-like wish for reciprocal misfortune. Such moral censure clashes starkly with the glamorous brand narrative that aims to celebrate Davido&rsquo;s success; Hall&rsquo;s (1980) notion of audience decoding makes it clear that audiences routinely produce oppositional readings, focusing on private controversies rather than the intended promotional message (Wren-Lewis, 1983).<br />5.1.5 Synthesis of Criticism<br />These moral and personal critiques intersect with direct health concerns about alcohol itself. Fig. 21&rsquo;s statement foregrounds the product&rsquo;s perceived dangers. Social media&rsquo;s unregulated climate, as Noel et al. (2018) observe, intensifies these conflicting attitudes: brands push luxury and lifestyle aspirations, while segments of the audience condemn alcohol as harmful. Rumors about Davido&rsquo;s personal behaviour further complicate this relationship seen in Fig. 22 by suggesting that an influencer&rsquo;s offstage actions cannot be separated from the brand&rsquo;s public image (Lateef, 2024). Disillusionment also arises from perceived irrelevance or declining star power, as Fig. 23 puts it. Groszman (2020) notes that influencer marketing hinges on ongoing audience connection; once followers sense that a celebrity&rsquo;s hype or authenticity has diminished, skepticism follows. Caldwell (2024) similarly points to the illusions propping up consumer culture, which unravel if the celebrity endorser&rsquo;s personal narrative appears incongruent with moral or communal expectations. This dynamic is especially salient in African contexts, where communal values and religious norms often demand higher ethical standards from public figures (Abah, 2009; Wright, 2015). Ultimately, these examples reveal how moral/religious critiques and personal conduct controversies heighten tensions between Davido&rsquo;s star image (as constructed by Martell) and the cultural values of his audience. What begins as a brand&rsquo;s celebratory message encouraging luxury cognac consumption collides with moral, health, and personal integrity concerns. As a result, many users produce oppositional or critical readings that question Davido&rsquo;s fitness as a role model and cast doubt on the brand&rsquo;s credibility (Wren-Lewis, 1983; Hall, 1980).<br />5.2 Praise<br />In contrast to the criticisms cataloged in Section 5.1, many users on X (Twitter) respond with enthusiastic support for Davido&rsquo;s partnership with Martell. This praise underscores how parasocial relationships (Hills, 2016; Liu, 2023) can engender strong emotional bonds and loyalty toward both celebrity and brand. At the same time, it invites a more critical lens on how digital fandom, algorithms, and selective decoding drive consumer behavior (Hall, 1980; Adorno &amp; Horkheimer, 1944).<br />5.2.1 Discovering Martell Through Davido<br /> <br />Fig 24 <br /> <br />Fig 25<br /> <br />Fig 26<br />These testimonies typify parasocial influence: fans perceive Davido as a reliable guide in lifestyle choices (Hills, 2016). According to Liu (2023), parasocial relationships foster a &ldquo;real connection&rdquo; in virtual communities, wherein audiences treat media figures&rsquo; endorsements as genuine personal recommendations. Moreover, Hansen (2016) suggests that digital fandom encourages &ldquo;value co-creation,&rdquo; whereby fans internalize a celebrity&rsquo;s brand preference and actively promote it within fan communities, though such glowing praise can also stem from algorithmic amplification (Groszman, 2020; Alam et al., 2024). Social media platforms systematically prioritise content from brand partners and celebrity influencers, turning &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; discovery into a heavily orchestrated campaign. As Adelabu et al. (2024) find in the Nigerian context, brand acceptance often hinges on repeated exposure and influencer credibility factors amplified exponentially in online spaces.<br />5.2.2 Emotional Bonding and Loyalty Declarations<br /> <br />Fig 27 <br />Fig 28 Fig 29 &ldquo;Tell me why I no go drink am till my belle burst?&rdquo; (There is no reason why I wouldn&rsquo;t drink Martell till my stomach bursts? fig 30<br /> <br />Fig 31<br />Such emotional bonds reflect a hallmark of parasocial intimacy (Hills, 2016; Liu, 2023), wherein fans conflate admiration for Davido with unwavering support for Martell. Muntean and Petersen (2009) explore how celebrities harness digital platforms to cultivate disclosure and intrusion, further deepening fans&rsquo; sense of personal closeness. In this vein, Davido&rsquo;s consistent brand messaging can feel &ldquo;personal,&rdquo; prompting fans to view Martell as part of their relationship with him. Yet, critics note the potential vulnerability of audiences who trust such endorsements without weighing financial or health implications (Noel et al., 2018). Indeed, Hall (1980) reminds us that these fans may be reading in a &ldquo;preferred&rdquo; way, absorbing the brand&rsquo;s aspirational script, while not negotiating or opposing it. From an Adorno &amp; Horkheimer (1944) perspective on the culture industry, celebrity promotions risk becoming a subtle form of mass persuasion, obscuring socio-economic divides behind the veneer of &ldquo;fan empowerment. &ldquo;This dynamic also resonates with the concept of &ldquo;internalized advertising,&rdquo; where fans conflate their emotional attachment to the celebrity with brand endorsement (Lateef, 2024). <br />5.2.3 Personal Success, Inspiration, and Communal Pride<br /> <br />Fig 32 <br />Fig 33 <br />Fig 34 &ldquo;See how Davido fresh abeg... Martell for life.&rdquo; (Please, look at how Davido is looking fresh).<br />Here, fans celebrate Davido&rsquo;s entrepreneurial savvy, labelling him &ldquo;king&rdquo; or &ldquo;master of deals&rdquo; and elevating Martell into a symbol of personal aspiration. Onanuga (2024) explores male celebrity rivalry and digital fandom in Nigerian hip hop, noting that fans often equate purchasing power with loyalty, an echo of how endorsements become markers of &ldquo;clout.&rdquo; Similarly, Malangke (2025) indicates that brand ambassadors in digital business thrive on associating commercial products with success narratives, fueling communal pride or &ldquo;hustle&rdquo; culture. By linking Martell with Davido&rsquo;s status, these posts reify a communal narrative that equates drinking Martell with upward mobility or &ldquo;making it&rdquo; in life. This dynamic aligns with how parasocial relationships can shape aspirational consumption: fans see Davido&rsquo;s partnerships as milestones, reflecting both the star&rsquo;s achievements and their own potential progression (Hills, 2016; Langmia &amp; Tyree, 2017). However, from a critical perspective, linking a premium alcoholic beverage to personal development may camouflage deeper socio-economic disparities (Adorno &amp; Horkheimer, 1944). Davido&rsquo;s star narrative can overshadow the stark reality that many fans cannot afford regular luxury consumption. As Hall (1980) and Abah (2009) observe, audiences are not passive: while some wholeheartedly embrace Davido&rsquo;s framing, others reject or resent its inaccessibility (see Section 5.1 Criticism).<br />5.2.4 Synthesis of Praise<br />Collectively, the positive posts reveal a dynamic interplay between fan devotion, brand messaging, and social media. On the surface, fans enthusiastically credit Davido for introducing them to Martell, profess unwavering loyalty, and extol his business acumen. From a more critical standpoint, the praise directed at Davido and Martell illustrates how celebrity influence can move beyond mere curiosity to become a deeply felt allegiance. The brand&rsquo;s alignment with Davido resonates strongly with fans who idealize his success story, conflating their support for him with endorsement for Martell even amid broader market critiques or moral disputes about alcohol. A notable aspect of this praise dataset is the selective omission of Davido&rsquo;s controversies. In Muntean &amp; Petersen&rsquo;s (2009) analysis, celebrities strategically curate which personal details to reveal or conceal, and fans, in turn, highlight only the narratives that uphold their admiration. As Hills (2016) and Hansen (2016) suggest, fandom communities often filter out inconvenient facts, sustaining a coherent and positive brand-celebrity image. This dynamic echoes Hall&rsquo;s (1980) explanation of how audience segments adopt &ldquo;preferred&rdquo; or &ldquo;negotiated&rdquo; readings of media texts; in this case, praise posts typically sidestep references to any negative or contradictory elements of Davido&rsquo;s public life. Consequently, user posts reveal a layered relationship between Davido, Martell, and the fan community. While enthusiasm prevails in the praise dataset, it remains tightly bound to broader processes of digital fandom, socioeconomic aspiration, and cultural identity formation in Nigeria&rsquo;s entertainment sphere (Lateef, 2024; Onanuga, 2024). Indeed, the same commodification critiqued in Section 5.1 simultaneously undergirds the fervent emotional commitment and loyalty observed here, demonstrating that influencer activities thrive on parasocial ties, algorithmic visibility, and the readiness of fans to interpret Davido&rsquo;s success as their own.<br />5.3 Sociopolitical<br />In contrast to the consumption-oriented reactions in Sections 5.1 (Criticism) and 5.2 (Praise), sociopolitical posts place Davido in a broader civic and moral spotlight. Here, audiences demand that Davido leverage his stardom for activism and public good, rather than confining himself solely to brand promotion. This perspective aligns with Archer and Sie&rsquo;s (2022) argument that celebrities often function as &ldquo;moral navigators,&rdquo; guiding fans&rsquo; ethical and political viewpoints, and Okorie&rsquo;s (2023) emphasis on the immense power of celebrities in African media spaces.<br />5.3.1 Expectation of Celebrity Activism<br /> <br />Fig 35 &ldquo;But you denied us when we needed you during end sars protest!! Oya naw&rdquo; (&hellip;Ok, we get your point now).<br />This user references the #EndSARS protest an anti-police-brutality movement that erupted in Nigeria in 2020, largely led by youth dissatisfied with systemic injustices. By stating &ldquo;you denied us,&rdquo; the post implies Davido was absent or insufficiently vocal during a pivotal moment, thus betraying fans who anticipated his support. According to Lateef (2024), Nigerian celebrities often occupy a unique space between state institutions and the public, with fans believing stars wield sufficient influence on effect social or political change. While Martell may encode Davido as a triumphant brand ambassador, audiences with sociopolitical demands decode such celebrity imagery as hollow if it lacks genuine activism (Hall, 1980). According to Archer and Sie (2022), celebrities often become anchors for moral evaluation, where fans seek ethical cues or endorsement of popular causes. The expectation is that Davido, having reaped influence and financial success, must reciprocate by aligning with grassroots struggles thus moving beyond the merely commercial image. Similarly, Okorie (2023) highlights that African celebrities can function as &ldquo;agenda setters,&rdquo; shaping national conversations. Fans expect more than entertainment from Davido; they demand that he join their fight against perceived injustices.<br /> <br />Fig 36<br />This user&rsquo;s post frames him as morally indebted to engage in direct sociopolitical action such as protests, especially regarding the contentious #EdoDecides2024 elections (Edo State gubernatorial election held on September 21, 2024). These decoding challenges the brand-coded image of a purely celebratory Afrobeat star and instead insists on his role as a &ldquo;people&rsquo;s champion&rdquo; (Hall, 1980). Langmia and Tyree (2017) argue that African celebrities occupy a space between state institutions and the public, reinforcing the moral obligations fans impose on them. From an understanding of Archer and Sie (2022), fans are effectively using Davido as a guide for moral navigation, looking to him for leadership in moments of crisis. This phenomenon also resonates with Adorno and Horkheimer&rsquo;s (1944) critique of the culture industry that while brand endorsements might prefer non-controversial star images, fans can oppose such refinement, demanding &ldquo;real&rdquo; activism from an idol who otherwise appears commodified.<br />5.3.2 Recasting Davido&rsquo;s Image: Cultural Ambassador or Corporate Spokesperson?<br />Fans increasingly view Davido through two competing lenses: as a &ldquo;Cultural Ambassador&rdquo; of Afrobeat and as a &ldquo;Corporate Spokesperson&rdquo; for Martell. The former perspective stems from Afrobeat&rsquo;s lineage, symbolized by Fela Kuti&rsquo;s activism and Pan-African ethos, which many believe Davido should inherit by publicly addressing social issues (Lateef, 2024). Okorie (2023) further argues that African celebrities wield symbolic power to rally public opinion, so audiences see &ldquo;Afrobeat pride&rdquo; as necessarily intertwined with activism. In contrast, Martell&rsquo;s encoded narrative portrays Davido chiefly as a stylish figure endorsing a premium cognac. From an oppositional stance (Hall, 1980), this portrayal of self-made success rings hollow if it fails to meet the moral or political expectations embedded in Afrobeat&rsquo;s heritage. As Adorno and Horkheimer (1944) observed, mass-mediated stars often reinforce commodified lifestyles rather than champion more profound societal commitments. Fans thus perceive a glaring disconnect between Davido&rsquo;s commercial poise and their desire for an outspoken Afrobeat icon, someone who, like Fela Kuti, melded music with sociopolitical consciousness (Lateef, 2024). These posts cast doubt on Davido&rsquo;s &ldquo;cultural ambassador&rdquo; status. Although Martell frames him as a triumphant exponent of Afrobeat pride and Nigerian excellence, critical audiences highlight the tension between that celebratory image and his silence on contemporary sociopolitical concerns. Hall&rsquo;s (1980) Encoding/Decoding model helps explain how the brand encodes Davido&rsquo;s image, while fans with pointed political demands decode his stardom as superficial if it dodges activism. <br />5.3.3 Synthesis of Sociopolitical Responses<br />Sociopolitical critics increasingly challenge Davido to reconcile his star power, lucrative brand partnerships, and the expectation that he leverage his platform for meaningful advocacy. While endorsements may spotlight a &ldquo;self-made&rdquo; success story, fans attuned to Nigeria&rsquo;s wider socio-political landscape decode Davido&rsquo;s public persona in more activist terms. Following Hall&rsquo;s (1980) Encoding/Decoding model, they reject purely entertainment-focused portrayals, foregrounding moral duties and civic engagement rather than passive consumerism.<br />This active audience negotiation becomes especially clear when fans reference protests such as #EndSARS or #EdoDecides2024 movements associated with demands for police reform, governance transparency, and electoral fairness. One user tweet, for instance, explicitly asks why Davido remains silent on #EndSARS despite consistently trending on social media for his musical achievements. Such commentary reflects how moral navigation (Archer &amp; Sie, 2022) increasingly drives celebrity- fan relations, as supporters expect stars to champion prominent social causes. Yet this expectation of public accountability can clash with the commercial dimension of Davido&rsquo;s persona. For younger demographics who regard Afrobeat as historically tethered to protest and social justice (Lateef, 2024), prioritizing brand success over communal advocacy erodes authenticity. The tension between commerce and conscience thus underpins the oppositional readings of Davido&rsquo;s stardom: failing to address pressing social issues positions him as a detached, corporate-endorsed figure rather than the transformative Afrobeat ambassador many fans desire. So then, these critiques highlight how celebrity success in Nigeria&rsquo;s entertainment landscape is not divorced from politics; indeed, fans expect stars to inhabit a civic role, speaking up for community interests (Langmia &amp; Tyree, 2017; Okorie, 2023). While Davido commands significant commercial influence, his sociopolitical legitimacy hinges on aligning with public grievances, particularly amid ongoing calls for reform. <br />6 CONCLUSION <br />The significance of this research lies in demonstrating that celebrity endorsements in Africa&rsquo;s alcohol industry, exemplified by Davido&rsquo;s partnership with Martell, cannot be understood solely as top-down advertising strategies. Rather, consumers navigate, challenge, and at times reshape these messages, revealing a dynamic interplay of cultural identity, socioeconomic realities, and moral obligation. While Martell aspires to project a glamorous, cosmopolitan ideal, many Nigerians respond by critiquing the product&rsquo;s high cost, calling out perceived personal failings in Davido&rsquo;s public persona, or demanding that he adopt activist stances consistent with Afrobeat&rsquo;s sociopolitical heritage (Adorno &amp; Horkheimer, 1944; Hall, 1980).<br />Crucially, these findings underscore the active role of local languages, particularly Nigerian Pidgin, through which fans express sarcasm, humor, protest, or reverence in equal measure. By providing translations of these statements, the project highlights the linguistic and cultural specificity underpinning audience reactions. In doing so, it reveals how global brands seeking to &ldquo;localize&rdquo; must recognize the potent cultural script they enter, where moral and civic expectations can override purely commercial messages.<br />Implications include the need for more ethically attuned influencer campaigns, particularly in environments where luxury branding may intensify class divisions or clash with conservative or faith-based values. Marketers must weigh the reputational risks of ignoring a star&rsquo;s offstage controversies or communal responsibilities. From a scholarly lens, this project reinforces the efficacy of qualitative discourse analysis and media theory for unpacking how digitally mediated endorsements evolve within complex moral and cultural climates.<br />The larger picture extends beyond a single celebrity endorsement: it speaks to how influencer culture in emerging markets becomes entangled with social justice discourses, religious mores, diaspora engagement, and historical legacies (e.g., Fela Kuti&rsquo;s activism). Researchers should explore parallel cases, whether in Nigeria, other African nations, or the broader Global South, to map the dialectics of cultural authenticity, brand commodification, and political accountability in an era of ubiquitous social media marketing.<br />Recommendations emerging from this study center on:<br />Holistic Brand Strategies: Global alcohol companies partnering with popular local celebrities should integrate community outreach or charitable elements, acknowledging socio-economic disparities.<br />Culturally Sensitive Messaging: Tailor campaigns to diverse audience segments, remaining aware that moral, religious, and political expectations vary widely across (and within) African contexts.<br />Proactive Celebrity Engagement: Influencers and celebrities can enhance authenticity by transparently addressing socio-political concerns, clarifying whether they support activist causes, and acknowledging local realities, thereby minimizing backlash or accusations of &ldquo;selling out&rdquo; cultural heritage.<br />In its entirety, Davido&rsquo;s Martell endorsement offers a small-scale version of how evolving Afrobeat stardom intersects with the demands of influencer capitalism, local identity, and civic responsibility. While this project spotlights only one slice of Nigeria&rsquo;s vibrant media ecosystem, it contributes to a broader understanding of the forces remaking African celebrity culture and the significance of fans&rsquo; voices often expressed in comedic, critical, or politicized Pidgin English within today&rsquo;s participatory digital spheres.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The study draws on a thematic<br />analysis of a short-form expository documentary with Michelle Dawes, the senior news<br />editor at BBC CWR, and contextualises it within a practice-based research framework. The<br />study investigates how a regional branch of the BBC's CWR continues to fulfil its public<br />service obligations amid significant industry disruptions.<br />The research is grounded in theories of public service media, participatory journalism, and<br />digital convergence. It addresses key questions: How does BBC CWR represent diverse<br />community voices? What strategies do they employ to engage digitally native and under-<br />represented audiences? And how does the station navigate the integration of digital<br />technologies while maintaining editorial integrity?<br />The findings reveal that BBC CWR actively seeks to embed itself within the community,<br />attending local events like the Godiva Festival to source stories reflective of its audience's<br />lived experiences. This method of editorial engagement mirrors participatory journalism<br />practices and reinforces the BBC's institutional commitment to diversity and inclusion.<br />Michelle's insights highlight the station's transition toward more relational and Responsive<br />journalism uses social Journalism uses social listening tools and platform-native storytelling<br />to engage with fragmented audiences across digital spaces.<br />5<br />Technologically, the station is embracing mobile journalism (mojo) and social-first content<br />strategies. Reporters are equipped with small production kits, which enable them to<br />produce, edit, and publish stories that are visually engaging and algorithmically optimised<br />for social media. These shifts reflect broader industry trends toward convergence and<br />hybrid media systems, where journalistic roles and formats are increasingly fluid and<br />multidisciplinary.<br />Despite this digital transformation, the civic function of local journalism remains central.<br />BBC CWR continues to hold local power structures accountable by highlighting hyperlocal<br />issues, such as petty crime and public service gaps&mdash;stories that, while often overlooked,<br />resonate deeply with the community. The station's ability to prompt responses from<br />councils and law enforcement underscores its role as a democratic watchdog.<br />The accompanying short-form interview documentary complements the essay by visually<br />articulating the newsroom&rsquo;s ethos and strategies, offering a dynamic perspective on<br />editorial practice. Together with a mock Instagram campaign, the project exemplifies how<br />traditional public service journalism can adapt to digital cultures without relinquishing its<br />core values.<br />In conclusion, BBC CWR serves as a compelling model of resilience and reinvention in local<br />journalism. Its hybrid approach&mdash; combining community-based reporting, digital fluency,<br />and civic responsibility&mdash; offers insights into how legacy media institutions can continue to<br />thrive in an increasingly participatory and digitised media environment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Introduction<br />Local journalism is critical for community building, local identity construction, and media<br />representation on the media scene. By prioritising community involvement and utilising<br />digital innovation, BBC Coventry &amp; Warwickshire demonstrate how regional media sources<br />are evolving to meet the changing requirements of their audience. This shift is reflected in<br />the station&rsquo;s emphasis on minority viewpoints, coverage of hyper-local topics, and direct<br />connection with listeners via digital media. Declining print circulation and fragmented media<br />consumption are putting traditional journalism methods under strain; to remain relevant<br />and trusted, BBC Coventry &amp; Warwickshire is revamping its strategy to include social media,<br />online content, and audience participation. The station&rsquo;s emphasis on inclusivity ensures<br />8<br />that all cultural, ethnic, and social groups in Coventry and Warwickshire can voice their<br />story, resulting in a more representative media landscape. The BBC Coventry &amp;<br />Warwickshire is responding to changing media habits by emphasising the importance of<br />local journalism in the digital age through projects that encourage grassroots storytelling<br />and digital outreach. Furthermore, the station&rsquo;s commitment to collaborating with local<br />creatives and developing future reporters demonstrates a proactive approach to preserving<br />local narratives. This dynamic evolution reflects a broader trend in journalism: combining<br />tradition with creativity to better serve and reflect the communities it represents.<br />2. LITERATURE REVIEW<br />This section analyses the conceptual framework that underlies my study, drawing on<br />multidisciplinary literature from media studies, journalism theory, and communication<br />sociology. The confluence of my topics focuses on a rich framework for investigating the<br />dynamics of local participation and journalism within current media contexts. Every field<br />adds unique yet complementary perspectives: media studies provide tools for<br />comprehending media systems, technologies, and cultural texts; journalism theory discusses<br />the standards, values, and practices moulding news production; and communication<br />sociology investigates the larger social settings and power relations affecting how<br />information is generated, disseminated, and received. Grounding the study in this<br />multidisciplinary approach helps me to critically interact with structural as well as cultural<br />components of journalism. It enables me to scrutinise how professional standards and<br />institutional pressures shape journalistic methods.<br />This approach considers the expectations and the local socio-political reality. Moreover, this<br />approach helps me to identify gaps in existing research, especially in terms of how local<br />media promotes identities. identities.<br />My study takes a qualitative approach. I conducted the study using a methodology that<br />included in-depth interviews, content analysis, and participant observation.<br />I selected these techniques due to their ability to capture the complexity of journalistic<br />activity and community involvement in specific contexts. These techniques have the<br />capacity to capture the intricacy of journalistic activity and community involvement in<br />specific contexts. The conceptual framework informs the methodological design, ensuring<br />that important theoretical issues guide data collection and analysis. Content analysis looks<br />at how local concerns are presented in media narratives; for example, interviews with local<br />journalists and community stakeholders help to investigate opinions of involvement and<br />representation. The framework also stresses reflexivity and ethical consciousness by<br />recognising the researcher&rsquo;s positionality and the possible influence of the study process on<br />9<br />participants. This study seeks to preserve credibility and academic rigour by being open<br />about theoretical influences and methodological decisions. All things considered, this<br />conceptual and methodological approach offers a thorough perspective from which to<br />investigate the Interaction between local journalism and community involvement is a<br />fascinating phenomenon. It enables me to conduct a complex investigation of how<br />journalism functions inside certain cultural and institutional settings and how it either<br />supports or hinders local public life and democratic discourse. By means of this method, my<br />research aims to provide fresh ideas for both scholarly controversies and pragmatic<br />conversations in the domains of journalism and communication.<br />2.1 PUBLIC SERVICE MEDIA (PSD)<br />The BBC Model and Public Service Media (PSM): Public Service Media (PSM) is defined as<br />media companies that are set up, financed, and controlled to benefit the public rather than<br />to create profit. While fostering democratic values, cultural diversity, and social cohesion,<br />their main goal is to inform, educate, and entertain people.<br />The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), which sets a worldwide standard for public<br />media institutions, is among the most well-known and powerful examples of PSM.<br />Founded in 1922 and with a Royal Charter, the BBC runs free of government and<br />commercial pressures, its income mostly coming from a compulsory licence fee paid by UK<br />households. This funding approach lets the BBC give public value priority above market-<br />driven factors. It is required to offer fair news, varied programming, and material that<br />reflects the nations and areas of the United Kingdom. The BBC's editorial<br />Independence, accountability systems, and a dedication to quality journalism demonstrate<br />the fundamental values of PSM.<br />By providing people dependable, fact-based information, free from political or commercial<br />bias, the BBC helps significantly foster democratic participation that is free from political or<br />commercial bias. Its encouragement of minority voices, local material, and instructional<br />programming also helps enhance social and cultural life. &ldquo;To inform, educate, and entertain&rdquo;<br />is&rdquo; its mission statement, defining public service broadcasting. The BBC has also become a<br />public service medium in the digital era, going beyond conventional broadcasting into social<br />media, podcasts, and online platforms. This growth guarantees it stays relevant in a shifting<br />media environment and still helps it meet its public duties. The BBC, meanwhile, still<br />struggles with political criticism, financing issues, and competition from worldwide<br />streaming providers. Critics and constraints notwithstanding, the BBC is still a crucial<br />institution in preserving journalistic integrity, promoting informed citizenship, and<br />maintaining cultural diversity in the realm of public service media (PSM). Public service<br />10<br />media (PSM) plays a crucial role in preserving journalistic integrity, promoting informed<br />citizenship, and maintaining cultural diversity.<br />The BBC upholds journalistic integrity, fosters informed citizenship, and preserves cultural<br />plurality. This sets a standard in the journalism industry, demonstrating how public media<br />can adapt and transform while maintaining its fundamental values. This case study offers a<br />useful experience for me to understand the role and future of PSM in a fast-changing media<br />environment.<br />2.2 Community and Participatory<br />Participatory and community journalism are types of news creation that actively engage the<br />public in shaping, generating, and disseminating news material. Emphasising cooperation,<br />local voices, and civic empowerment, these methods question conventional top-down<br />media. Under the Public Service Media (PSM) framework, as shown by organisations like the<br />BBC, community and participatory journalism are democratic extensions of the public<br />service goal: to inform, incorporate, and involve all parts of society. Historically, the BBC has<br />stressed national coverage, but recently, it has come to see the need for local and<br />community involvement more. Projects like the BBC Local Democracy Reporting Service<br />(LDRS) and alliances with independent local media outlets show a change toward<br />participatory methods. These initiatives integrate community journalists into local settings,<br />ensuring that news priorities accurately represent under-represented perspectives and<br />hyperlocal concerns. This approach increases media responsibility and public confidence as<br />well as broadens news material.<br />Participatory journalism also comprises audience-driven strategies, including narrative, user-<br />generated content, and cooperative investigative efforts. These strategies let communities<br />define the agenda, draw attention to urgent concerns, and question prevailing narratives. In<br />PSM, such approaches are vital to being relevant in a time of digital fragmentation and<br />audience doubt in mainstream media. Furthermore, interactive Journalism helps with civic<br />empowerment and media literacy. Involving the public in journalistic processes helps<br />demystify news creation and motivates people to be active producers instead of passive<br />consumers. This approach fits the BBC&rsquo;s public service objectives of promoting an informed<br />and involved population.<br />Meaningful participatory journalism inside PSM systems, however, calls for an institutional<br />dedication to inclusiveness, editorial openness, and resource distribution. Critics contend<br />that although several public broadcasters use the concept of participation, real community<br />input may still be constrained by structural disparities and gatekeeping. Ethical behaviour,<br />inclusive policies, and a willingness to share editorial control all help create sustainable,<br />participatory journalism. Policies, along with a willingness to share editorial control, all<br />contribute to the creation of sustainable participatory journalism. To sum up, community<br />11<br />and participatory journalism are two crucial instruments for reviving PSM in the 21st<br />century. By means of projects like those at the BBC, these models provide avenues for a<br />more democratic media environment, more complex storytelling, and more active public<br />involvement, where the public is not only an audience but also a co-creator of news and<br />information.<br />2.3 Digital Media Transformation<br />Digital media has changed the very nature of the production, distribution, and consumption<br />of journalism. This change has enabled faster reporting, wider access, and more creative<br />narratives, thereby making journalism more responsive, inclusive, and engaging. It has also<br />changed the function of journalists and their audiences in the media environment at the<br />same time. Jenkins (2006) presents &ldquo;convergence culture&rdquo;, a concept describing the<br />intricate, dynamic interaction between ancient and modern media. Audiences in this<br />environment are not only passive consumers but also active participants who comment,<br />share, and even generate news material. Chadwick (2013) elaborates on this notion by<br />defining a &ldquo;hybrid media system&rdquo; in which the urgency and virality of digital platforms<br />compete with conventional journalistic standards such as editorial verification. This dual<br />pressure shapes newsroom operations and credibility maintenance. The BBC, specifically<br />through BBC CWR, exemplifies the effective implementation of digital transformation. The<br />station has embraced mobile journalism (mojo) strategies allowing reporters to directly<br />record, edit, and publish articles from their phones. The practice enables more genuine, on-<br />the-ground narratives and faster turnaround times. Designing stories especially to succeed<br />on sites like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, BBC CWR has also adopted social-first<br />material approaches.<br />The desire to create material that &ldquo;pops off the page&rdquo; for social media users emphasises<br />how visual appeal and immediacy have become crucial to digital journalism, as Michelle,<br />senior news editor at the BBC CWR, points out. Reaching fragmented audiences has also<br />become more dependent on multiplatform production&mdash;creating material for social, web,<br />television, radio, and other platforms.<br />These developments show a more general industry trend; there is a trend in which reporters<br />must be multi-skilled, changing their work to fit various digital platforms while maintaining<br />journalistic standards. platforms while maintaining journalistic standards.<br />The digital revolution has also driven data journalism, live reporting, interactive storytelling,<br />and broader audience involvement through comments, surveys, and user-generated<br />content. These developments help reporters clarify difficult topics and encourage more<br />public involvement with the news. Although digital media creates difficulties, like false<br />information and financial uncertainty, it also renews journalism by making it more nimble,<br />innovative, and audience-orientated. Especially when organisations like the BBC change<br />their operations to more accurately reflect the habits and expectations of today&rsquo;s digital<br />12<br />audiences, the move to digital provides chances to enhance the public service function of<br />journalism.<br />3. Methodology<br />Using BBC CWR as a case study, this project investigates how digital media transformation<br />has changed journalistic practices by means of a qualitative research method. The aim is to<br />examine how a local journalistic institution operates within a society through the lens of a<br />short film produced locally, complemented by traditional qualitative tools.<br />The research design includes observational research, content analysis, depth interviews,<br />and the production of a short-form interview documentary featuring a senior editor,<br />Michelle Dawes, at BBC CWR. My short documentary is not only a creative output but also a<br />methodological component designed to visually and realistically represent and contextualise<br />findings drawn from my research. It helps foreground the voices of the senior BBC<br />journalists and illustrates the working culture within the newsroom, offering a compelling<br />and accessible format to synthesise thematic concerns around digital storytelling,<br />representation, and platform adaptation, according to BBC CWR.<br />This analysis looks at how ideas like convergence culture (Jenkins, 2006) and hybrid media<br />systems (Chadwick, 2013) show up in the daily content plans of a public service broadcaster<br />adapting to the digital age. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key editorial<br />staff and digital content producers, particularly those involved in mobile journalism (mojo)<br />and social media strategy. These interviews uncover the editorial reasoning behind digital-<br />first practices and how journalists reconcile traditional values with new media demands.<br />Over a two-month period, a content analysis of BBC CWR&rsquo;s output on Instagram, Facebook,<br />and Twitter was carried out. The analysis identified recurring trends in visual language,<br />storytelling formats, platform-specific engagement, and thematic focus, ranging from<br />community stories and breaking news to public interest content. As Michelle, the BBC<br />CWR&rsquo;s senior news editor explains in the documentary that this strategy aims to create<br />posts that &ldquo;pop off the page&rdquo; while remaining locally relevant.<br />Ethnographic observations, conducted both virtually and in person where possible,<br />captured newsroom workflows, use of mobile technology, and cross-platform content<br />planning. Observing the production environment helped illuminate how digital immediacy,<br />editorial verification, and audience analytics shape the rhythms of everyday journalism.<br />The study adopts constructivist epistemology, recognising that knowledge is co-created with<br />participants and situated within the specific sociocultural setting of BBCCWR. Ethical<br />13<br />considerations include informed consent, participant anonymity upon request, and<br />transparency regarding the use and dissemination of research materials that involve<br />audiovisual content.<br />By blending academic methods with my documentary practice, this project captures both<br />the strategic and experiential dimensions of digital media change in local journalism. It<br />contributes to broader discussions about the future of public service media in hybrid digital<br />environments, offering a multi-modal perspective on how BBC CWR navigates the tensions<br />between public value and the demands of digital engagement.<br />4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br />4.1 Research Questions<br /> How does BBC Coventry represent the diverse voices and stories of the city through<br />its programming?<br /> The examples of how local Coventry events or issues are highlighted in the BBC&rsquo;s<br />coverage and how this impacts the community?<br /> What role does BBC Coventry play in shaping the media culture of the city, especially<br />in terms of engaging young audiences?<br /> What is the future of local journalism in Coventry, and what steps is BBC Coventry<br />taking to evolve with changing media landscapes?<br /> How does BBC CWR engage with local events, artists, performers, and creators to<br />bring Coventry's cultural scene to a broader audience through BBC Coventry&rsquo;s<br />platforms?<br />4.2 Aims<br />The aim of this study is to critically examine the role of BBC Coventry &amp; Warwickshire (BBC<br />CWR) as a local public service broadcaster in reflecting community diversity, advancing civic<br />values, and engaging with digitally native and marginalised audiences through evolving<br />journalistic practices.<br />4.3 Objectives<br />14<br />1. The objective is to explore how local public service journalism mirrors community<br />diversity.<br />a. Investigate how BBC CWR&rsquo;s editorial decisions and journalistic practices<br />reflect the social, cultural, and ethnic diversity of Coventry and Warwickshire.<br />b. Examine the station&rsquo;s efforts in fostering a sense of belonging among<br />different community groups.<br />c. Evaluate the representation of inclusion and social equity within its content.<br />2. To assess BBC CWR&rsquo;s audience outreach and social media integration strategies<br />a. Analyse how BBC CWR uses digital platforms to reach and engage younger,<br />under-represented audiences.<br />b. Examine the effectiveness of interactive content, podcasts, video formats,<br />and social media campaigns in fostering local engagement.<br />c. Investigate how the station adapts to digital-first content trends to meet<br />audience expectations.<br />3. To examine how local editorial choices reflect broader institutional and civic values<br />a. Explore how BBC CWR aligns its editorial decisions with the wider public<br />service mission and institutional principles of the BBC.<br />b. Assess how its reporting upholds or interrogates values such as neutrality,<br />democracy, and community engagement.<br />c. Analyse how these editorial choices influence public perceptions of the<br />station&rsquo;s role in the local civic landscape.<br />5. Research Design<br />The research design employs a triangulated approach, combining three primary research<br />methods: qualitative thematic analysis, practice-based media production, and theoretical<br />integration. This approach ensures a comprehensive analysis of the ways BBC Coventry &amp;<br />Warwickshire (BBC CWR) engages with community diversity, incorporates digital<br />technologies, and adheres to its public service remit. By integrating these methods, the<br />research offers a holistic perspective on the station&rsquo;s newsroom practices, editorial<br />strategies, and digital engagement initiatives.<br />5.1 Qualitative Thematic Analysis<br />15<br />The first part of the study is a qualitative thematic analysis, which prioritises the<br />investigation of important topics related to the portrayal of various groups, digital<br />involvement, and public service values in the BBC's CWR editorial practices. A chosen set of<br />research materials, interviews, transcripts, editorial material, and outreach tools created by<br />BBC CWR will form the basis of this study. These materials will include digital content&mdash;such<br />as social media posts, podcasts, and website articles&mdash;and conventional broadcasts.<br />Thematic categories will be specific; they will look at how the BBC CWR interacts with<br />different community organisations and reflects local social, cultural, and ethnic diversity in<br />its material. The study will delve into the ways in which BBC CWR tailors its editorial content<br />to cater to diverse audience segments such as digitally native groups, younger listeners, and<br />under-represented communities. Examining how BBC CWR incorporates developing digital<br />technology into its programming, creation, and dissemination helps shape the station's<br />engagement strategy. The study will also scrutinise how the station's editorial policies align<br />with the BBC's broader public service responsibilities, which encompass neutrality,<br />openness, and social responsibility. The theme study will offer a thorough mapping of how<br />BBC CWR reflects the demands of its audience and the obstacles it encounters in fulfilling its<br />public service objectives in an ever more digital and varied media environment.<br />5.2 Practice-Based Media Production<br />The short-form documentary I used for this study represents an attempt to graphically<br />communicate its findings. This hands-on media artefact provides a creative and<br />introspective look at BBC CWR as a local public service broadcaster.<br />Concept and Goal The documentary features an in-depth interview with the BBC CWR senior<br />editor about the station&rsquo;s changing approach to community representation, digital<br />storytelling, and public service values in a digital media environment.<br />5.3 Theoretical Integration<br />The last part of the study combines the results of the qualitative thematic analysis with<br />the theoretical frameworks developed during the literature evaluation. This phase<br />ensures the study's conceptual foundation and alignment with broader academic<br />discussions on public service broadcasting, digital innovation, and community<br />involvement.<br />16<br /> Public Service Broadcasting Theory: The framework will frame the study within<br />the ideals and values that characterise public service media, including<br />impartiality, social responsibility, and serving the public interest.<br /> Digital Engagement and Media Consumption Theory: This framework will be<br />used to analyse how digital platforms, notably social media, have changed the<br />connection between broadcasters and consumers, particularly with respect to<br />younger, more diverse populations. This theoretical viewpoint will be used to<br />assess how well BBC CWR portrays under-represented groups and includes<br />their voices in its editorial material.<br />These theoretical perspectives help me to understand the findings from the theme analysis,<br />leading to a more profound understanding of how BBC CWR&rsquo;s newsroom practices both<br />mirror and challenge broader ideas about institutions, civic life, and media. This study uses a<br />combined approach that mixes qualitative thematic analysis, hands-on media production,<br />and theoretical ideas to bring together real data and theoretical insights. This approach will<br />offer a thorough knowledge of the issues and innovations influencing BBC CWR&rsquo;s newsroom<br />processes, thus providing a nuanced analysis of how local public service journalism interacts<br />with and adapts to the needs of a varied and digitally connected audience. By combining<br />qualitative analysis, hands-on media creation, and theoretical ideas, it can deeply explore<br />how BBC CWR is balancing community engagement, public service broadcasting, and digital<br />changes.<br />6. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION<br />6.1 Representing Diverse Voices<br />Michelle&rsquo;s remarks emphasize the station&rsquo;s active role in sourcing stories from<br />under-represented communities. The use of community events as both engagement<br />platforms and editorial scouting grounds illustrates a strategy of embeddedness<br />journalism. This aligns with Couldry&rsquo;s (2004) assertion that media production is<br />relational, not just institutional.<br />For instance, Michelle describes how reporters attend events like the Godiva<br />Festivals should find stories that reflect the lived realities of their audiences. This<br />approach democratizes the news agenda, moving beyond elite sources to include<br />everyday voices. Such practices reflect the ideals of participatory journalism<br />17<br />(Howley, 2010) and affirm the BBC&rsquo;s obligation to reflect &ldquo;the UK, its nations,<br />regions and communities&rdquo; (BBC Charter, 2017).<br />6.2 Audience Engagement and Social Listening<br />BBC CWR&rsquo;s senior news editor mentioned a central issue in the short-form documentary:<br />the distinction between \"signed-in, switched-on\" audiences and those who are digitally<br />disengaged. BBC CWR acknowledges the challenge of reaching young people, ethnic<br />minorities, and socially excluded groups; strategies such as &ldquo;social listening&rdquo; and monitoring<br />social media channels represent a shift toward networked journalism (Beckett, 2008).<br />These efforts go beyond analytics; they involve cultural competency and editorial<br />humility. As Michelle mentioned in the documentary, the station must go where the<br />audiences are; rather, this approach is more effective than expecting viewers to conform to<br />traditional formats. This philosophy aligns with Jenkins&rsquo; (2006) notion of convergence,<br />where media institutions must become permeable and interactive.<br />6.3 Mobile Journalism and Platform-Native Content<br />The pivot toward mobile journalism is particularly noteworthy. The provision of<br />mojo kits, mobile tools for reporting and editing, signals a reorientation of the<br />newsroom&rsquo;s workflow. Reporters are now expected to be producers, editors, and<br />visual storytellers. This collapse of roles is indicative of the post-broadcast era.<br />In this context, speed, interactivity, and visual appeal surpass traditional formats.<br />Michelle&rsquo;s observation that the station&rsquo;s digital presence should &ldquo;pop off the page&rdquo;<br />The situation highlights the aesthetic and technical demands of digital news because we<br />now optimise content not only for clarity but also for shareability. This resonates with<br />Carlson&rsquo;s 2020) analysis of the algorithmic pressures facing journalists in the attention<br />economy.<br />6.4 Accountability and Civic Infrastructure<br />18<br />Despite these digital innovations, BBC CWR retains its foundational role as a<br />platform for public accountability. Michelle states in the documentary that coverage of<br />shoplifting is an example: a seemingly mundane issue that resonates deeply with residents.<br />The newsroom&rsquo;s attention to such topics, and its role in catalysing responses from<br />Councils and law enforcement reflect journalism's civic function (Pickard, 2020).<br />This dual identity as both digital innovator and democratic watchdog - places<br />BBC CWR is at the heart of debates about the future of local journalism in Coventry and<br />across the UK.<br /> Can public service outlets adapt to digital cultures without sacrificing their civic<br />responsibilities?<br /> The BBC CWR&rsquo;s case suggests that the answer lies in hybridity:<br />blending community engagement with platform-savvy storytelling.<br />7. CONCLUSION<br />This project examined BBC Coventry &amp; Warwickshire's responsive, inclusive, and digitally<br />fluent local journalism strategy. The station employs social listening, mobile journalism,<br />community involvement, and interactivity as part of its strategy to adapt as a legacy<br />institution in a fragmented and changing media environment.<br />Despite this change, public service journalism's values remain strong. BBC CWR is trusted<br />and crucial in local media because it represents various views, holds local power accountable,<br />and promotes civic dialogue. Its tale is about endurance, reinvention, and purpose&mdash;not just<br />survival.<br />This is my first significant experience with filming, and it has been a profound learning<br />experience. Using the camera and editing suite, I witnessed and shared the real-time pulse of<br />local journalism. This documentary let me combine intellectual investigation with creative<br />practice, something I'll pride myself on and be grateful for.</p>",

As digital platforms increasingly shape human communication and societal trends, researchers require robust mixed-methods approaches to capture both self-reported attitudes and observable online behaviors. The proposed methodology combines quantitative and qualitative techniques to provide a holistic understanding of social media phenomena across disciplines such as psychology, sociology, and public health.</p>\n<p>The research design employs a sequential mixed-methods approach, beginning with survey administration to collect self-reported data on users' perceptions, attitudes, and reported behaviors. Careful attention is given to sampling strategies, instrument development, and validation to ensure data quality. The survey component is complemented by systematic content analysis of publicly available social media posts, utilizing both manual coding and computational methods to examine thematic content, emotional tone, and engagement patterns. The paper details procedures for developing coding frameworks, establishing inter-coder reliability, and analyzing large datasets through natural language processing techniques.</p>\n<p>Key ethical considerations are addressed, including privacy protection, data anonymization, and compliance with platform policies, particularly when studying sensitive topics or vulnerable populations. The methodology acknowledges the strengths of triangulating survey and behavioral data while recognizing limitations such as self-report biases in surveys and the lack of demographic context in public posts.</p>\n<p>This integrated approach offers significant advantages for social media research, enabling researchers to compare stated attitudes with actual online behavior and uncover potential discrepancies. The paper concludes with recommendations for adapting the methodology to evolving platforms and incorporating emerging computational techniques while maintaining rigorous research standards. The framework provides valuable guidance for scholars investigating the complex relationship between digital communication and human behavior in an increasingly mediated world. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Introduction:<br />Mental health discourse has been transformed in the digital age, with social media sites like Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter as the new public spaces for these deeply intimate discussions. Where such discussions used to be kept in clinical settings or in the mainstream media, now they unfold in the messy, unedited world of social streams and viral moments. This has brought both unparalleled potentialities and disquieting consequences that call for our serious reflection.</p>\n<p>The democratisation of mental health talk has certainly done an awful lot of good. Everyday people sharing their own experiences have helped normalise depression, anxiety and other conditions in a way that might have been difficult for professional campaigns to achieve. The raw, unfiltered accounts travelling through our news feeds have brought mental illness to life as much less theoretical, much more concrete, especially to younger generations grown digital-native. But this very availability has established new problems that make the therapeutic potential of these sites more difficult.</p>\n<p>What begins with genuine disclosure grows increasingly problematic through social media's like-dependent mechanisms. The Instagram beautification of mental illness struggles - photographs filtered to express mood with attendant earnest descriptions of depression - distills complex medical illnesses down into pretty material. On TikTok, the rapid-fire format reduces complicated psychoanalytic concepts into simplistic checklists, with serious disorders like ADHD or OCD being the subject of viral challenge. None of these platforms set out to distort mental health information, but their underlying structures reward precisely the kinds of reductionist, emotionally-charged content that produces misinformation.</p>\n<p>The phenomenon of algorithmic amplification creates particularly pernicious feedback loops. As consumers are exposed to mental health content - either through legitimate interest or voyeurism - the platforms become more and more severe manifestations of similar content. A teenager who views a single video on anxiety may find that their whole feed is subsequently filled with entries about panic disorder, cutting oneself, or other serious issues. This creates a sort of \"diagnosis contagion,\" researchers say, as normal emotional responses are normalized through the repeated, ongoing exposure to clinical terms.</p>\n<p>Expert practitioners record the actual effect playing out in their waiting rooms. Some report a surge of young patients presenting with self-diagnoses from social media, often believing they have diseases they don't understand. The DSM-5, the diagnostic manual of psychiatry, is reduced to TikTok sound bites, where complex differential diagnoses are overlooked for viral symptom lists. This puts huge pressure on mental health services as practitioners spend precious session time deciphering and frequently clearing up misconceptions instead of offering therapy.</p>\n<p>Commercialization of mental health material adds an additional ethical layer to this already complex problem. Influencers who build careers on their own personal psychological struggles have perverse motivations to provide increasingly sensationalized reports. Others enter risky ground, dispensing unqualified advice or recommending questionable treatments to engaged fans. Meanwhile, the platforms themselves gain the benefit of this sensitive content in the form of ad dollars, but provide woefully inadequate safeguards against the spread of harmful misinformation.</p>\n<p>Even more quietly, these distorted representations affect cultural attitudes towards mental illness in ways that affect us all, and not just those of us who engage in social media. When diseases are a fashion statement or disposable metaphor (\"I'm so OCD about my desk\"), it diminishes the very real suffering of those who endure these conditions. The difference between raising consciousness and trivializing mental illness starts to grow very fine indeed when depression is a \"vibe\" and anxiety a personality type.</p>\n<p>But in spite of all these risks, social media remains an important tool for campaigning on mental health. The solution isn't to retreat from them, but to create more evolved forms of digital mental health literacy. This requires collaboration between platforms, mental health professionals, teachers and users themselves to create environments where necessary discussion can occur without descending into misinformation or exploitation.</p>\n<p>The future will need to address several key issues. First, platforms will need to take responsibility for how their algorithms amplify and enable toxic content, producing more sophisticated means of dealing with mental health information. Second, we need to increase digital literacy so that users are empowered to critically engage with mental health content. Third, the mental health community needs to meet people where they are - acknowledging the influence social media has on knowledge and providing authoritative, accessible information to combat misinformation.</p>\n<p>As we navigate this shifting terrain, we must remember that beneath each viral clip and trending topic are real human beings seeking to be understood and connected. Our job is to retain the compassion and openness that makes social media such a powerful tool for mental health advocacy while guarding against distortions and ills that result when complicated medical issues meet engagement-driven platforms.<br />Literature Review:<br />Media plays a crucial role in shaping public perceptions of mental illness. Over the years, scholars have examined how different forms of media&mdash;from traditional news outlets to social media platforms&mdash;influence stigma, awareness, and public discourse around mental health. The relationship between media and mental health is complex, as portrayals can either challenge harmful stereotypes or reinforce them, depending on framing, intent, and audience reception. This literature review synthesizes key findings from studies on media representations of mental illness, focusing on three main themes: (1) the role of media in reinforcing or reducing stigma, (2) the dual impact of social media on mental health discourse, and (3) theoretical frameworks that explain media influence on public perceptions. By analyzing these themes, this review highlights gaps in current research and suggests directions for future studies. <br />Media depictions of mental illness have historically been fraught with stereotypes, often associating psychiatric conditions with danger, unpredictability, or moral failing (Corrigan et al., 2017). Arendt, Scherr, and Romer (2019) conducted an experimental study comparing the effects of stigma-reducing and stigma-reinforcing media portrayals. They found that exposure to positive narratives&mdash;such as stories emphasizing recovery and resilience&mdash;led to more empathetic attitudes toward individuals with mental illness. Conversely, portrayals that linked mental illness with violence or incompetence reinforced existing prejudices. <br />These findings align with cultivation theory (Gerbner &amp; Gross, 1969), which argues that repeated exposure to media messages shapes viewers' perceptions of reality. When mental illness is consistently framed in a negative light, audiences are more likely to adopt stigmatizing beliefs. Moncrieff and Moore (2019) further highlight how the casual misuse of mental health terminology (e.g., describing minor quirks as \"OCD\" or mood swings as \"bipolar\") contributes to public misunderstanding. Such trivialization can minimize the severity of actual disorders, making it harder for those affected to seek help without fear of judgment. <br />Efforts to combat stigma through media have shown mixed results. Corrigan et al. (2017) conducted a meta-analysis of anti-stigma interventions and found that campaigns emphasizing personal contact&mdash;such as testimonials from individuals with lived experience&mdash;were most effective. However, they also noted that one-off media campaigns often have limited long-term impact unless reinforced by sustained public education efforts. <br />Chen (2021) examined historical shifts in media representations from the late 20th to early 21st century, finding that while overtly negative stereotypes have declined, subtler forms of stigma persist. For example, news coverage may frame mental illness as a personal tragedy rather than a systemic healthcare issue, inadvertently reinforcing individual blame rather than advocating for structural solutions. <br />Social media has revolutionized mental health discourse by providing platforms for peer support, advocacy, and awareness-raising. Naslund et al. (2016) argue that online communities can reduce isolation by connecting individuals with shared experiences. Platforms like Reddit, Facebook groups, and mental health forums offer spaces where people can discuss symptoms, treatment options, and coping strategies without fear of stigma. <br />Additionally, social media has enabled grassroots mental health movements, such as #MentalHealthAwareness and #EndTheStigma, which challenge traditional media&rsquo;s often-negative framing. These campaigns have been particularly impactful among younger demographics, who are more likely to seek mental health information online rather than through traditional sources (Choukas-Bradley et al., 2020). <br />Despite its benefits, social media also poses significant risks. Choukas-Bradley et al. (2020) describe the \"good, the bad, and the unknown\" of adolescent social media use, noting that while some content is educational, other material&mdash;such as unverified self-diagnosis trends&mdash;can be harmful. TikTok, in particular, has been criticized for spreading misinformation about conditions like ADHD and dissociative identity disorder (DID), with users often glamorizing symptoms for engagement (Green &amp; Wyllie, 2023; Hallowell, 2024). <br />Pugh and Bell (2020) critique the *aestheticization* of mental illness on platforms like Instagram and Tumblr, where conditions such as depression and anxiety are stylized with moody visuals and poetic captions. While these posts may intend to foster solidarity, they risk romanticizing suffering, potentially discouraging professional treatment in favor of performative suffering. <br />Fuchs (2017) argues that social media algorithms amplify sensational content, often prioritizing emotionally charged posts over nuanced discussions. This can create echo chambers where extreme narratives&mdash;either overly positive or negative&mdash;dominate mental health discourse. For example, a study by Kgatla (2024) found that viral TikTok trends often simplify complex mental health issues, reducing them to catchy slogans or \"relatable\" memes that lack clinical accuracy. <br />McCombs and Shaw&rsquo;s (1972) agenda-setting theory posits that media doesn&rsquo;t tell people *what to think* but *what to think about*. In the context of mental health, this means that media coverage determines which issues (e.g., suicide rates, therapy accessibility) enter public consciousness. For instance, high-profile celebrity disclosures about mental health struggles&mdash;such as Demi Lovato&rsquo;s bipolar disorder advocacy&mdash;have led to spikes in public discussions about treatment options (McDuffie &amp; Roy, 2018).</p>\n<p>However, agenda-setting also has downsides. When media disproportionately covers violent incidents involving mentally ill individuals, it reinforces the false association between mental illness and danger (Corrigan et al., 2017). Conversely, underreporting on systemic issues (e.g., lack of mental healthcare funding) means these topics remain marginalized in public discourse.</p>\n<p>Hall&rsquo;s (1997) work on representation examines how media constructs meanings through language and imagery. In mental health discourse, this manifests in two key ways: <br />1. Medicalized vs. Social Models&ndash; Traditional media often frames mental illness through a medical lens (e.g., \"chemical imbalances\"), while social media sometimes adopts a social model (e.g., \"trauma responses\"). These competing narratives influence whether audiences view mental health as an individual or societal issue. <br />2. Identity and Marginalization&ndash; Media representations often exclude marginalized voices, such as those of racial minorities or LGBTQ+ individuals. For example, *The Intersection of Mental Health and Dating for South Asians* highlights how cultural stigma complicates mental health discussions in certain communities, yet mainstream media rarely addresses these nuances. <br />Niche Communities and Global Perspectives<br />Recent studies have begun exploring mental health discourse in niche online communities. For example: <br />- Tiwari and Singh (2023) analyze how social media influences political mental health narratives in India post-COVID. <br />- *The Impact of Art on Mental Health* examines how platforms like DeviantArt and Behance allow users to express psychological struggles creatively. <br />- Kgatla (2024) investigates the romanticization of mental illness in online activism, where some influencers blur the line between advocacy and glorification.</p>\n<p>However, most research remains Western-centric, with limited studies on non-English-speaking or Global South communities. <br />A major gap in current literature is the lack of longitudinal studies on social media&rsquo;s mental health impact. While short-term effects (e.g., mood changes after viewing certain content) are well-documented, long-term consequences&mdash;such as whether self-diagnosis trends lead to better or worse clinical outcomes&mdash;remain understudied.</p>\n<p>Additionally, more research is needed on how algorithmic curation shapes mental health perceptions. For instance, does YouTube&rsquo;s recommendation system steer vulnerable users toward harmful content (e.g., pro-anorexia forums) or supportive resources? <br />This review underscores the dual-edged nature of media in mental health discourse. Traditional media can either challenge or reinforce stigma, while social media offers both community support and risks of misinformation. Theoretical frameworks like cultivation theory, agenda-setting, and representation theory help explain these dynamics, but gaps remain&mdash;particularly in understanding long-term effects and cross-cultural differences.</p>\n<p>Future research should: <br />1. Investigate algorithmic biases in mental health content curation. <br />2. Expand studies to non-Western and marginalized communities. <br />3. Develop best practices for media professionals to portray mental illness responsibly.</p>\n<p>By addressing these gaps, scholars and practitioners can better harness media&rsquo;s potential to foster informed, empathetic discussions about mental health. <br />Findings:<br />The research survey titled \"Mental Health on Social Media\" aimed to explore perceptions and experiences related to mental health content online. The survey gathered responses from 89 participants, primarily from the younger demographic. The vast majority, approximately 67.8% of the respondents, were between 18 to 24 years old. Another 32.2% fell in the 25 to 35 age group, and a small portion, around 5%, were over 35. This skew towards younger participants is significant, as it reflects the demographic most engaged with social media platforms.<br />Almost all participants reported being active on social media, with 98% confirming their regular engagement with various platforms. This high engagement rate is not surprising given the age distribution of the sample. The most frequently mentioned platforms included Instagram, TikTok, X (formerly known as Twitter), and Reddit. Instagram was the most dominant, but many respondents listed multiple platforms, indicating a diverse consumption of digital content. Interestingly, some also mentioned niche or unexpected platforms such as Discord, Tumblr, and Pornhub, which suggests that mental health content is widespread across various digital spaces.<br />The survey also asked about participants' mental health diagnoses. About 47.5% stated that they had been diagnosed with a mental health condition, while 45.8% said they had not. A smaller group, 6.7%, chose not to disclose this information. The nearly even split between diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals provided a balanced perspective on the topic, allowing for insights from both those with lived experience and those with observational viewpoints.<br />Regarding exposure to mental health-related content, most respondents indicated frequent encounters. About 30.5% stated that they sometimes see mental health content on their feeds, 28.8% said they often do, and 27.1% reported seeing such content very often. A small minority encountered it rarely or never. These numbers reveal that mental health topics are prevalent in online spaces, whether in the form of educational posts, memes, comedic skits, or personal stories.<br />However, despite the frequency of exposure, the perception of the accuracy of mental health portrayals on social media was less optimistic. Only 15.2% of respondents agreed that mental health disorders are portrayed accurately. A significant number, 37.3%, disagreed, and another 35.6% remained neutral. A further 10.2% strongly disagreed. These results suggest a widespread skepticism regarding how mental health issues are represented online. The findings imply that while social media is a powerful tool for spreading information, it often falls short in conveying the realities of mental illness accurately.<br />The study also delved into how mental disorders are perceived in terms of romanticization and trivialization. A substantial 83% of respondents believed that mental disorders are romanticized on social media. Specifically, 54% agreed and 28.8% strongly agreed with this sentiment. In terms of trivialization, 64.3% agreed or strongly agreed that mental disorders are trivialized. These responses indicate a pervasive concern among users that mental health conditions are often depicted in ways that either glamorize suffering or reduce serious issues to superficial trends. Such portrayals can contribute to misunderstanding and stigma, even if they are intended to be humorous or relatable.<br />Participants were also asked whether they believed social media has contributed to lessening the stigma surrounding mental health. Here, the responses were more varied. A slight majority, 50.8%, agreed that stigma has been reduced through social media, and 18.6% strongly agreed. Meanwhile, 18.6% remained neutral, and 10.2% disagreed. This mixed response highlights that while some see progress in societal attitudes facilitated by online discourse, others remain cautious or unconvinced of social media's role in destigmatization.<br />A critical component of the study involved evaluating the impact of mental health trends and viral content. Participants were shown examples or asked to reflect on trends and asked if they believed these trends accurately represented the struggles associated with mental disorders. About 44% of participants felt that these trends did offer some representation of real struggles, while 27.1% disagreed or strongly disagreed. An additional 18.6% expressed neutrality. This spread of opinion indicates that the representation of mental health in trends is a divisive topic, with many acknowledging that while some content can be genuine and enlightening, much of it risks oversimplifying complex experiences.<br />When asked whether such trends should be promoted, the responses were even more divided. About 33.9% of participants supported promotion, 33.9% were against it, and the remaining third remained neutral. These numbers reveal a high level of ambivalence, likely stemming from a conflict between the desire to spread awareness and the need to avoid misrepresentation or exploitation.<br />An especially telling result came from the question about whether the type of viral or stylized content typically seen online could be demeaning to individuals with mental illness. A significant 66.1% of respondents agreed that such content could be demeaning. Only 8.5% disagreed, and 25.4% remained neutral. These responses show that while such content might be popular or even well-intentioned, it often misses the mark and can inadvertently contribute to harmful stereotypes or alienate those who are directly affected.<br />The issue of representation was further explored in a question about whether content like comedic skits or memes accurately depicted mental health. The majority of participants expressed disapproval. Over 50% either disagreed or strongly disagreed that these content types represented mental health issues accurately, while only 1.7% strongly agreed. About a quarter of the respondents remained neutral. This indicates that although humorous or viral content might raise awareness, it often lacks the depth and sensitivity required to handle the topic appropriately.<br />On the broader question of influence, 81.3% of respondents believed that such content does indeed affect how people perceive mental health. This suggests that despite its flaws, online content holds considerable sway over public opinion and can shape attitudes in meaningful ways. It reinforces the need for content creators and platforms to be mindful of the messages they disseminate.<br />One of the most strongly supported findings came from a question about the role of social media platforms themselves. When asked whether platforms should take further steps to monitor and regulate mental health-related content, an overwhelming majority of 76.3% agreed or strongly agreed. Only a small fraction, 6.8%, disagreed. This consensus points to a public demand for increased accountability and responsible management of mental health narratives online. It suggests a need for better content moderation, the promotion of verified information, and possibly partnerships with mental health professionals to guide digital discourse.<br />Open-ended responses, although fewer in number, provided valuable qualitative insights. Some participants expressed that trends could help normalize mental illness and create dialogue, but they also worried that these portrayals often made mental health issues appear quirky or trendy. One comment noted, \"Lowkey feel like content like this helps to normalize mental illness but also makes it look quirky or cool.\" Another respondent appreciated that some content offers a more accurate portrayal than traditional media but emphasized that such content can still be misinterpreted or misused. These reflections underscore the complexity of the topic and the need for nuanced, context-aware discussions around mental health in digital spaces.<br />In conclusion, the findings from this study paint a complex and often contradictory picture of mental health representation on social media. While platforms are widely used and mental health content is frequently encountered, the quality and impact of this content vary greatly. Many respondents recognize the potential for social media to reduce stigma and increase awareness. However, there is significant concern about the romanticization, trivialization, and inaccuracy of portrayals. The influence of trends and viral content is especially contentious, with a substantial number of users feeling that such media can be demeaning or misleading.<br />There is a clear call for increased responsibility from social media platforms. Participants want better moderation, more educational content, and a stronger emphasis on authenticity and respect. For content creators, mental health advocates, and platform developers, these findings offer a roadmap for more ethical and effective engagement with mental health topics online. Moving forward, it will be crucial to balance creative freedom with psychological integrity, ensuring that the digital landscape becomes a safer, more supportive environment for all individuals, regardless of their mental health status.<br />Content Analysis:<br />This section features an in-depth content analysis of the social media posts used as case studies on the survey for opinions whilst diving deeper into survey responses about the posts.<br /> <br />The first post featured on the survey was the social media trend known as bed rotting&mdash;the act of remaining in bed for prolonged periods while engaging in minimal or passive activity, such as scrolling through a phone, binge-watching shows, or doing nothing at all. It gained popularity on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Promoted through hashtags like #bedrotting, #mentalhealth, and #selfcare, the trend is often framed as a form of rest or emotional decompression. However, while it is positioned in many posts as a legitimate form of self-care or resistance to burnout, a more critical examination reveals that the normalization of bed rotting on social media may carry significant psychological and cultural risks.<br />Qualitative analysis of social media posts associated with the trend shows that users often present bed rotting through an aestheticized lens&mdash;dim lighting, cozy bedding, snacks, and captions that blend irony with self-deprecation. This framing can obscure the underlying behaviors as symptoms of deeper emotional distress, including depressive withdrawal, executive dysfunction, or chronic avoidance. While the language used around bed rotting suggests agency&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking a break,&rdquo; or &ldquo;my nervous system needs this&rdquo;&mdash;in many instances, the behaviors align more closely with patterns of disengagement and emotional paralysis than intentional rest.<br />The repeated glamorization of passive withdrawal from life responsibilities can have detrimental effects on both individuals and the broader mental health discourse online. For individuals experiencing clinical depression or anxiety, seeing bed rotting portrayed as trendy or even aspirational may reinforce maladaptive coping mechanisms, discouraging help-seeking behavior or the development of more sustainable emotional regulation strategies. Instead of validating emotional experience in a supportive or therapeutic context, the trend risks trivializing serious mental health struggles, reducing them to relatable, commodified content.<br />Moreover, the virality of this trend underscores the performative nature of social media wellness culture. Users may feel pressured to present their emotional exhaustion in a visually appealing or witty manner, which can lead to a disconnect between authentic experience and online representation. This performativity can further stigmatize those who suffer silently or whose experience of mental illness does not conform to the curated aesthetic associated with trends like bed rotting.<br />Another concerning aspect is the lack of critical dialogue around when rest becomes harmful. While temporary disengagement can be necessary for recovery, the repetition and celebration of bed rotting as a lifestyle&mdash;or even as identity&mdash;can normalize chronic inactivity and avoidance. Without context or nuance, this trend can send the misleading message that staying in bed for days at a time is a sufficient or healthy substitute for actual mental health care or interpersonal support.<br />In conclusion, although the bed rotting trend may offer comfort or validation to some users, it also presents risks by romanticizing withdrawal and minimizing the complexity of mental health challenges. As with many social media trends centered around mental wellness, its popularity should be met with a critical lens&mdash;one that recognizes the importance of rest, but also the dangers of aestheticizing emotional dysfunction. Responsible mental health discourse must move beyond relatable content and engage with the difficult, often non-linear realities of psychological wellbeing.<br /> <br />The second post was a Tiktok video posted by user @panchbantz on the 5th of May, 2024 offers a comedic take on ADHD. This kind of content, though relatable to some, often lacks nuance and may reinforce stereotypes, presenting mental illness as something amusing or aesthetic rather than deeply impactful and, at times, debilitating. When such portrayals dominate online discourse, they can desensitize viewers to the severity of mental health challenges and discourage more serious engagement with the realities of these conditions. In turn, this contributes to a culture where emotional suffering is packaged for entertainment, and genuine experiences risk being misunderstood, dismissed, or glamorized.<br />The video uses satire and exaggerated behavior to depict the experiences and everyday realities of individuals with mental health or neurodevelopmental conditions. Through a series of short, fast-paced skits, the creator highlights behaviors commonly associated with ADHD (such as impulsivity or distractibility. The tone remains humorous throughout, leaning into internet meme culture and familiar social media tropes to enhance relatability and shareability.<br />One prominent theme is the normalization of mental health discussions. The video makes use of humor not to mock mental illness, but to portray it in a way that is both approachable and resonant with those who may have lived experience. As such, it contributes to the destigmatization of neurodivergence, offering a space where viewers can find affirmation, solidarity, or simply feel seen.<br />Another theme that emerges is community-building. By referencing shared experiences that are often underrepresented or misunderstood in mainstream media, the creator builds rapport with their audience. In the comment section, viewers often express appreciation for the accuracy of the portrayal, or share their own stories. This type of engagement reflects how social media can function as a site of collective understanding and peer support, especially for marginalized identities like those with ADHD or autism.<br />At the same time, the video's reliance on humor raises critical questions about the potential for misinterpretation. While many viewers might find the content validating or educational, there is a risk that some audiences could misread the exaggerated portrayals as reductive or even stereotypical. Mental health conditions are nuanced, and while comedy can be an effective entry point for dialogue, it can also inadvertently flatten or oversimplify complex experiences.<br />The cultural significance of this video lies in how it reflects a broader trend on TikTok, where creators use short-form, visually engaging, and emotionally expressive content to explore personal and collective mental health narratives. As supported by recent scholarship (e.g., Prichard et al., 2023; Munro et al., 2024), social media is increasingly a space where young people especially engage in identity-making and advocacy around mental health. Content like this navigates the intersection between entertainment and education, personal storytelling and public discourse.<br />According to the survey, 34.5% of participatns strongly agree that content like this affects how people view mental health while another 62.1% agree. One participant said,&rdquo; While I think it can be somewhat beneficial to people who suffer mentally ill to see content like this and feel seen and understood, I think this might actually contribute to the trivialisation and misunderstanding of mental illnesses. Jokes might help people cope with mental illnesses or feel solidarity and support from other individuals making and resonating with these jokes, I feel that sometimes it may paint a picture of mental health issues and neurodivergency that is very incomplete.&rdquo; Another participant answered,&rdquo; For people who are educated about this topic, the hyperbole becomes clear and some people might like the humor, some might not. However, people who are not uneducated about the topic might reinforce the portrayed exaggerated behavior as inherently linked to everyone with ADHD which could lead to more stigmatization and prejudice.&rdquo;<br />In conclusion, @panchbantz&rsquo;s TikTok serves as both a form of comic relief and a vehicle for neurodivergent self-representation. It exemplifies how creators are using digital platforms to foster awareness and community, while also illustrating the complexities that arise when sensitive topics are addressed through humor. While the video is effective in starting conversations and creating a sense of solidarity, ongoing critical engagement with such content is necessary to ensure mental health representation remains both authentic and responsible.<br /> <br />The third video was another trend popular on TikTok related to mental health. This ttrend has involved creators using humor and satire to represent and communicate the realities of living with mental health conditions such as ADHD, OCD, autism, and depression. The video by user @bbrawl3y serves as a compelling example of this trend. In it, the creator uses rapid-fire comedic sketches to embody traits and behaviors associated with various neurodivergent conditions, all performed with irony, exaggeration, and meta-awareness. This analysis will examine the video not in isolation, but as part of a broader pattern of performative mental health content that blends entertainment with self-disclosure.<br />The central feature of this trend is the use of humor as a tool for communicating psychological and neurological experiences. In @bbrawl3y&rsquo;s video, humor serves multiple functions: it lightens the emotional weight of stigmatized subjects, it increases relatability and shareability, and it frames the creator as both vulnerable and in control of their narrative. The video presents a series of hyperbolic character sketches that simultaneously parody and embody traits commonly associated with ADHD, OCD, and other neurodivergent identities. These portrayals are not intended to be clinical representations; rather, they draw on shared online vernacular and self-diagnosis culture that is deeply embedded in Gen Z digital expression.<br />Importantly, the content aligns with a broader digital trend in which humor becomes the dominant mode for processing and communicating psychological distress. This mode of expression speaks to a generation that has grown up navigating mental health crises alongside economic precarity, social instability, and the ever-present pressure to maintain a curated personal brand. The trend of humorous self-pathologization on TikTok allows creators to communicate their internal struggles in a way that is engaging, socially permissible, and algorithmically favorable. For example, the pacing, editing style, and language choices in @bbrawl3y&rsquo;s video are highly optimized for TikTok&rsquo;s format, reflecting the pressures of digital attention economies.<br />However, the implications of this trend are not entirely benign. While the use of humor and satire may offer temporary relief or solidarity, it can also lead to the oversimplification and commodification of mental health conditions. In videos like @bbrawl3y&rsquo;s, complex and often debilitating symptoms are repackaged into digestible, comedic formats that may inadvertently perpetuate stereotypes or minimize the seriousness of certain disorders. When viewed repeatedly in algorithm-driven content loops, such representations can reinforce narrow or inaccurate understandings of neurodivergence, particularly for viewers without firsthand experience.<br />Furthermore, this trend reflects a broader tension in online mental health discourse: the balance between authenticity and performance. While creators like @bbrawl3y may be drawing on genuine experiences, they are also navigating a digital landscape that rewards virality, relatability, and aesthetic cohesion. As a result, mental health content becomes subject to the same demands of branding and marketability as any other form of influencer culture. This raises important ethical questions about what is gained&mdash;and what may be lost&mdash;when deeply personal struggles are reframed as entertainment content.<br />Although 44.8% of the survey participants agree that this trend represents the struggles of having a mental health condition, only 20.7% agree that this trend should be promoted. The majority (34.5%) are neutral to this stance. One participant said,&rdquo; It might not be representative of everyone suffering from OCD, but it certainly serves diminishing stereotypes. I am always happy to come across a video like this because it might express what a certain condition actually feels like.&rdquo; Another participant answered,&rdquo; Because it's coming from someone who actually have these mental health issues and they would be the best at portraying and describing what they feel, instead of someone who has no clue and makes assumptions.&rdquo; Another participant said,&rdquo;The reason people are diagnosed with certain disorders is that they disrupt their ability to function day-to-day. Psychological disorders aren't some cute, romantic, and/or quirky trait that some people have. Sure, it's healthy to have a sense of humour if you have a mental disorder, but content like this is important because it shows them as they really are. It doesn't trivial or dismiss them.&rdquo;<br />In conclusion, the video by @bbrawl3y is emblematic of a broader trend on TikTok wherein humor becomes a primary means of articulating mental health experiences. While this mode of expression can foster connection, validation, and community, it also risks trivializing complex conditions and reducing them to shareable tropes. As mental health content continues to proliferate in digital spaces, critical engagement with how these narratives are constructed, consumed, and monetized is more important than ever. The line between visibility and oversimplification is thin, and creators and audiences alike must remain conscious of how trends shape our understanding of mental wellbeing.<br />Discussion:<br />The discussion around mental health representation on social media platforms is both timely and complex. Drawing on the findings from the survey-based study and integrating key theoretical and empirical insights from academic literature, this discussion aims to critically engage with how mental health is depicted, understood, and influenced by online environments. The focal point lies in understanding both the potential and pitfalls of social media in shaping public perception and individual experiences of mental health.<br />The survey revealed a clear trend in which the younger demographic (18&ndash;24) dominates social media usage and is most exposed to mental health-related content. This observation is echoed by Choukas-Bradley et al. (2020), who emphasize that adolescents and young adults are uniquely susceptible to both the positive and negative consequences of social media engagement. While platforms can facilitate support and destigmatization, they can also exacerbate anxiety, depression, and the internalization of harmful stereotypes. The findings from the survey reflect this dual nature, with participants expressing appreciation for increased awareness but also deep concern about romanticization and trivialization.<br />A central issue emerging from the data is the romanticization of mental illness. An overwhelming 83% of respondents believe mental illness is glamorized on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. This is supported by Kgatla (2024), who critiques the transition of mental health discourse from activism to aesthetic influence. The curated, stylized portrayals&mdash;often in the form of soft, melancholic visuals paired with music&mdash;contribute to what Pugh and Bell (2020) term the &ldquo;aestheticisation of mental health.&rdquo; While these representations can normalize discussions, they risk distorting the harsh realities of mental health struggles and turning them into trends for likes and shares.<br />This issue ties closely to Hall&rsquo;s (1997) theory of representation. According to Hall, media doesn&rsquo;t just reflect reality but actively constructs it through signs, images, and language. In the context of social media, mental illness is often signified through visual tropes that align more with artistic or trendy content than clinical reality. These constructed images shape how audiences perceive mental illness, frequently reinforcing reductive or glamorized ideas. For example, the association of depression with poetic sadness and aesthetic solitude may erase the more debilitating aspects of the disorder, such as anhedonia, suicidal ideation, or chronic fatigue.<br />The trivialization of mental health, reported by 64.3% of survey respondents, compounds this issue. Moncrieff and Moore (2019) discuss how misuse of mental health terminology&mdash;like using \"OCD\" to describe neatness or \"bipolar\" to denote mood swings&mdash;distorts public understanding. This semantic slippage not only undermines the experiences of those genuinely affected but also propagates misinformation. Green and Wyllie (2023), in their study on ADHD content on TikTok, highlight similar concerns. They found a significant proportion of videos to be inaccurate or misleading, potentially encouraging self-diagnosis without professional intervention.<br />Despite these concerns, the data shows that a majority of respondents (69.4%) believe social media has helped lessen the stigma associated with mental health. This perception aligns with Corrigan et al. (2017), whose meta-analysis demonstrates that contact-based strategies&mdash;wherein people share personal stories&mdash;are effective in reducing stigma. Platforms like Reddit and Instagram have become spaces where individuals openly discuss diagnoses, therapies, and daily challenges, humanizing conditions that were previously hidden or vilified. Naslund et al. (2016) suggest that peer-to-peer support via social media can enhance mental well-being and foster community-based care networks. Thus, while stylization may be problematic, authentic storytelling holds substantial potential for public education and empathy.<br />This dichotomy between stigma reduction and misrepresentation leads us to Arendt, Scherr, and Romer&rsquo;s (2019) work on media portrayals. They assert that exposure to stigma-reducing media can positively shift attitudes, but stigma-reinforcing content can entrench biases. The ambiguity of social media lies in its simultaneous capacity to host both types. The survey&rsquo;s finding that only 15.2% of respondents believe mental illness is portrayed accurately exemplifies this dual effect. Many users encounter content that is either superficial or satirical, diluting the message. Meanwhile, others are influenced by sincere accounts that challenge dominant narratives.<br />The virality of content adds another layer of complexity. According to McCombs and Shaw&rsquo;s (1972) agenda-setting theory, media doesn&rsquo;t tell people what to think, but what to think about. When mental health trends go viral, they direct collective attention toward these issues. However, this does not ensure depth or accuracy. As seen in the survey, participants are divided on whether trends accurately represent mental illness, and over two-thirds believe such content can be demeaning. This tension reflects Gerbner and Gross&rsquo;s (1969) cultivation theory, which posits that prolonged media exposure shapes worldviews. If users are repeatedly exposed to oversimplified or romanticized portrayals, they may come to perceive mental illness through these narrow lenses, impacting both societal attitudes and self-perception.<br />The role of social media platforms themselves came under scrutiny in the survey, with 76.3% of respondents calling for more regulation and monitoring. This demand is grounded in growing awareness that algorithms prioritize engagement over ethics. Fuchs (2017) critiques the capitalist logic underpinning social media, where user interaction is commodified, often at the expense of well-being. The proliferation of controversial or sensational content&mdash;such as dramatic TikTok videos portraying breakdowns&mdash;may not align with public health interests but serves to generate clicks and shares.<br />Indeed, the commodification of mental health as content raises ethical concerns. When mental illness becomes a brand aesthetic, it risks exploiting genuine suffering for monetization or visibility. McDuffie and Roy (2018) argue that digital storytelling should prioritize responsibility and truthfulness, particularly when engaging with vulnerable communities. This is echoed in Chen&rsquo;s (2021) exploration of how media representations influence public perception over time. The stakes are high, especially when adolescents or those undiagnosed interpret content as validation of unverified self-diagnoses.<br />Another poignant insight from the survey is the perceived influence of social media on how people understand mental health. A significant 81.3% of respondents believe content shapes perceptions. This highlights the need for critical media literacy. As Black (2017) notes in the context of education, digital fluency must extend beyond technical skills to include the capacity to critically assess information. Without such literacy, users are vulnerable to misinformation, bias, and harmful normalization of mental health stereotypes.<br />Despite these challenges, the potential for positive change remains. Hall&rsquo;s (1997) theory of encoding and decoding reminds us that audiences are not passive. They interpret messages through their own cultural contexts. Thus, while some may internalize glamorized portrayals, others decode them critically, recognizing their limitations. This variance underscores the need for diverse, authentic content that offers multifaceted representations.<br />In considering solutions, Naslund et al. (2016) advocate for collaboration between mental health professionals and content creators. Co-produced content&mdash;combining clinical accuracy with engaging formats&mdash;can bridge the gap between accessibility and authenticity. Likewise, digital platforms must take proactive steps to flag harmful content, amplify credible voices, and create safe spaces for discourse.<br />In sum, the findings from the survey align closely with broader academic concerns. Social media is a powerful tool in shaping mental health discourse, capable of both destigmatizing and distorting. The romanticization and trivialization of mental illness, while drawing attention, often undermine nuanced understanding. Yet, platforms also offer unprecedented opportunities for peer support, education, and community building. The challenge lies in steering this digital ecosystem towards ethical representation, informed consumption, and compassionate engagement. By drawing from scholarly insights and centering the lived experiences of users, we can move towards a more responsible and effective use of social media in mental health advocacy.<br />Conclusion:<br />In reflecting upon the multifaceted influence of social media on mental health representation, this study underscores the dichotomy at the heart of digital engagement. On one hand, social media has democratized discourse, giving voice to marginalized experiences and fostering a sense of community and support for those grappling with mental health issues. On the other hand, it has simultaneously perpetuated stereotypes, misused clinical terminology, and glamorized psychological suffering in ways that are both harmful and misleading.<br />The insights gleaned from the survey reveal a generation highly engaged with and influenced by online portrayals of mental health. Young people, in particular, are not only the primary consumers of social media content but are also its key contributors. Their experiences highlight an urgent need to navigate between authenticity and aestheticization. While personal storytelling can reduce stigma and promote empathy, the tendency to stylize or romanticize illness for online validation diminishes the seriousness of these conditions and distorts public understanding.<br />The academic literature further supports these concerns. Theoretical frameworks such as Hall&rsquo;s theory of representation and the agenda-setting and cultivation theories from McCombs and Shaw (1972) and Gerbner and Gross (1969) respectively, illuminate the mechanisms through which media content influences public consciousness. They help explain why repeated exposure to glamorized depictions of mental illness may not only desensitize audiences but also reshape their perception of what it means to live with a mental health condition. Moreover, the findings from Corrigan et al. (2017) and Arendt et al. (2019) suggest that while media can reduce stigma through authentic representation, it can just as easily reinforce negative stereotypes if not carefully managed.<br />The commodification of mental health content, driven by platform algorithms and user engagement metrics, adds another layer of complexity. As Fuchs (2017) argues, the capitalist underpinnings of social media often prioritize virality over veracity. In such an environment, nuanced discussions are frequently overshadowed by more sensational or emotionally charged content. The survey&rsquo;s call for increased regulation and oversight reflects a growing awareness among users that mental health should not be treated as entertainment.<br />Nevertheless, the potential for social media to serve as a force for good remains significant. Authentic digital storytelling, peer-to-peer support, and informed advocacy efforts can help shift narratives from sensationalism to solidarity. Collaboration between mental health professionals and content creators, as suggested by Naslund et al. (2016), could lead to more accurate and helpful representations. Furthermore, fostering digital literacy among users is vital in equipping them to critically evaluate the content they consume and share.<br />Ultimately, this research advocates for a balanced and ethical approach to mental health representation online. While social media will undoubtedly continue to evolve as a space for mental health discourse, its impact&mdash;positive or negative&mdash;will depend largely on the intentions behind content creation and the critical engagement of its audiences. By embracing both scholarly insights and community voices, we can work towards a digital culture that not only destigmatizes mental illness but also respects the complexity and individuality of mental health experiences.</p>",

Kuti's work is placed in the historical context of British colonial rule in Nigeria and the neocolonial structures that remained after independence, including military dictatorships, foreign economic intervention, and cultural alienation. This is done by drawing on postcolonial and critical race theories. The analysis uses theoretical frameworks from Kwame Nkrumah, Homi Bhabha, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&rsquo;o, Frantz Fanon, and Gayatri Spivak to comprehend how Fela&rsquo;s music regained African cultural pride and fought political persecution. This essay shows how Kuti used traditional Yoruba aesthetics, Pidgin English, and Afrobeat fusion to critique Western influence and re-establish a connection with indigenous roots through a thorough analysis of important songs, including Zombie, Colonial Mentality, Sorrow, Tears and Blood, and Coffin for Head of State. The \"Third Space\" and Bhabha's idea of hybridity are utilized to illustrate how Fela negotiated identity while avoiding both unquestioning traditionalism and cultural imitation. Meanwhile, Fela's use of approachable language and symbols, which gave voice to Nigeria's disadvantaged, echoes Spivak's concept of the subaltern. The essay concludes that Afrobeat was a locus of cultural resistance and rebuilding as well as a genre and philosophy. By providing a radical, hybrid arena for reclaiming identity, envisioning freedom, and opposing prevailing systems of control, Fela Kuti's music became a potent force for decolonizing the African psyche.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Introduction</p>\n<p>Colonialism has left a lasting impact on Nigeria's political, economic and cultural landscape. As a former British colony, Nigeria underwent substantial change under colonial rule from the early 19th century to independence in 1960. That period of colonization imposed Western political systems, economic structures and cultural ideologies on Nigerian society often at the expense of indigenous traditions and identities. With the introduction of the British administration's indirect rule system and Christian missionary education, local customs and knowledge systems were marginalized (Falola, 2009). Even after independence, colonial ideologies have remained in the form of neocolonial influence, elite domination and cultural alienation. It was a political and economic as well as an epistemological project that redefined Nigerians self-image and place in the world. The placement of Eurocentric values produced what Frantzi Fanon (1952) called the \"Colonized Mind,\" the internalization of colonized inferiority feelings. This internal struggle between indigenous identity and Western ideals continues to shape postcolonial Nigerian society and its cultural expressions.</p>\n<p>In response to such historical dynamics, artists as Fela Anikulapo Kuti became agents of cultural resistance and political criticism. Fela Kuti was a Nigerian musician, composer and activist who pioneered Afrobeat - a mix of Yoruba rhythms with jazz, funk and highlife. More than just a musical style, Afrobeat was a vehicle for political activism addressing colonial legacies, military occupation and cultural exclusion. In his music Fela criticizes both internal and external oppression. He has released powerful tracks including &ldquo;Zombie&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sorrow Tears and Blood&rdquo;, &ldquo;Colonial Mentality&rdquo; and &ldquo;Coffin for Head of State&rdquo;. His lyrics call for the return to African cultural values as he challenges the blind obedience of military regimes, decry neoliberal governance and violence imposed by them. For a wider Nigerian audience, he sang in Pidgin and sometimes used Yoruba proverbs, customs and symbols. This makes Fela's work thus an ideal case study for examining how music might be used for postcolonial resistance and identity reconstruction. Such a mixing of local and global influences also represents what postcolonial theorist Homi Bhabha call cultural hybridity - a \"Third Space\" where new resistant identities can emerge.</p>\n<p>Literature Review</p>\n<p>Edward Said &ndash; Orientalism and the Construction of the &ldquo;Other&rdquo;<br /> The postcolonial field continues to find Edward Said's 1978 book Orientalism as its foundational study due to its analysis of Western power structures which strengthen Western dominance through constructed knowledge systems. The concept of &ldquo;Orientalism&rdquo; described by Said signifies a thinking style which establishes fundamental differences between &ldquo;Occident&rdquo; (West) and &ldquo;Orient&rdquo; (East) as ontological and epistemological categories. According to Said the binary classification did more than create academic or cultural divisions because Western powers used it to validate their imperialistic rule and economic mastery. Said explains that Western academic works alongside cultural products like art and literature distorted Eastern representations into romanticized unrealistic entities which led to a development of an inferior Oriental \"Other.\" Said talks about how these representations were not neutral entities but existed within power-knowledge structures as Foucault described them. Oriental knowledge production activities including travel writing and philology and anthropology and colonial administration provided Westerners with superior control while eliminating non-Western perspectives. According to Orientalism, identity construction and cultural storytelling along with epistemological systems in colonized regions underwent Western manipulation to serve imperial projects.<br />Said's Middle Eastern and Northern African and Asian geographic interest does not limit his theoretical methods which effectively apply across different continents with emphasis on Africa.</p>\n<p>The African region during colonial times also applied essentialist and dehumanizing depictions as disciplinary tools of control. The Western world depicted Africa as a singular dark primitive space holding no history that needed Western enlightenment according to Mudimbe (1988) and Achebe (1977). Through these artistic renditions colonial administrators sought to establish both the natural and legitimate basis for colonial dominance by showing that imperialism carried a spiritual character as colonization. Through creating Africa as an opposition to Europe colonial authorities achieved their goal of reshaping African cultural traditions together with indigenous identities and historical narratives which supported their colonial interests.</p>\n<p>The process of &ldquo;Othering&rdquo; transformed into cultural hybridity and ambivalent colonial discourse. Homi Bhabha (1994). Those subject to African colonizers found themselves trapped in a double bind of conflicting identity roles that fused childishness and demonic characteristics while being labeled both civilized and savage throughout the colonial era and beyond its formal dissolution. Said demonstrated in his broader study that colonialism functioned beyond economic purposes because it formed an epistemological system which transformed both the self-perception and outside perception of colonized communities. Through his research Said shows us the severe historical impacts of colonialism in Africa. The research shows how European values removed African identities by devaluing these cultures and redesigning them into new biased forms. The analysis of Orientalism functions beyond its review of Western scholarship because it prompts scholarly investigation into representation's underlying power structures to enable indigenous perspectives in their fight against colonialism and cultural identity recovery.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, Edward Said's Orientalism is still a work in postcolonial theory that shows how Western knowledge systems reinforced imperial power by constructing distorted representations of the \"Other.\" In the context of Africa, we see how similar tactics were used to suppress and remake cultural identities. Exhibiting these means of resistance and critical examination of colonial narratives also supports reclamation of indigenous voices and histories, in formerly colonized areas.</p>\n<p>Homi Bhabha &ndash; Hybridity, Mimicry, and the Third Space<br /> Postcolonial theory credits Homi Bhabha as its main figure because he examines the forthcoming identity forces within colonial and postcolonial socio-cultural domains. Through his work The Location of Culture Bhabha (1994) establishes three main concepts which undermine traditional notions of identity and cultural essence through Hybridity and Mimicry and the Third Space. The postcolonial societies of Bhabha do not establish cultural identity through static or singular traditions and ethnicities. Identity development flows as a shifting process between colonizer and colonized who engage in cultural translation and negotiation practices.<br />Bhabha (1994) introduces the concept of hybridity which describes the cultural outcomes developing from the border space between colonizers and colonized communities he terms the &ldquo;Third Space&rdquo;. The Third Space exists between colonial and indigenous territories because it functions as an enunciation ground where hybrid identities form. Hybrid spaces operate beyond cultural fusion by allowing both cultural meanings to be rewritten and colonial control systems to break down.</p>\n<p>According to Bhabha, in this space between the colonial and indigenous positions colonial discourse loses its coherence because it contains intrinsic flaws and because colonized people show their personal agency. The underpinning philosophical scheme consists of destabilizing traditional colonial power dichotomies like self/other, civilized/primitive, or West/non-West because they concede that the contested space allows alternative power frameworks (Bhabha, 1994). Through Bhabha's interpretation scholars analyze how colonial cultural identities transformed during Africa's colonial period by means of ongoing exchanges between colonizers and indigenous people. African societies during colonialism implemented European cultural elements including language, education and religion because doing so enabled their survival and resistance instead of assimilation (Ashcroft, Griffiths, &amp; Tiffin, 2007).</p>\n<p>According to Bhabha&rsquo;s theory of mimicry the colonized people perform colonial behaviors yet demonstrate the foundations of colonial power structures to be unstable. The phenomenon of mimicry functions at an exact level while showing traces of colonial power structure instability. Bhabha (1994, p. 86). The concept of the Third Space functions effectively as a tool to study present-day African postcolonial identity development. African societies of today demonstrate how colonial remnants have influenced their cultural development without making them duplicate Western standards. The contemporary postcolonial cultural landscape exhibits intricate mixed traditions because indigenous elements blend with and occasionally adapt components from Western perspectives and worldwide impacts (Loomba 2015). Postcolonial African literature and other cultural elements including fashion and political discourse and language demonstrate characteristics of synthesis that prevent simple classification. In their writing so do writers Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&rsquo;o and Wole Soyinka who combine local oral traditions with European literary forms to present complex African realities (Ogude, 1999; Gikandi, 2001).<br /> Through his emphasis on ambivalence and negotiation Bhabha progresses past the single-dimensional thinking of cultural dominance. Through this lens colonized people retain their self-authority while showcasing the innovative ways they restructure their sense of self. His work presents the basis to transform postcolonial authenticity perspectives into recognizing identities that develop through innovation and resistive and transformative processes. Through his theory of hybridity Homi Bhabha provides essential tools to study how African identities evolved through complexities during and after colonial rule. The work of Homi Bhabha provides scholars with vital analytical tools to examine cultural negotiation processes in transition zones which advances postcolonial studies as well as ongoing research about African identity in global contexts.<br /> In conclusion Homi Bhabhas notions of Hybridity, Mimicry and the Third Space are tools for understanding postcolonial identity. Contesting fixed binaries &amp; highlighting cultural interaction, Bhabha shows how colonized people redefined themselves through resistance, adaptation and creativity. And he continues to shape postcolonial discourse especially in African contexts by arguing that identity is dynamic and emerges through cultural exchange and transformation.</p>\n<p><br />Gayatri Spivak &ndash; Subaltern Voice and Representation<br /> Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak&rsquo;s made contributions to postcolonial theory, particularly through her seminal essay &ldquo;Can the Subaltern Speak?&rdquo;. Since the 1980s, they have heavily influenced scholarly discourse around voices, agency and representation. In this study, Spivak digs deep into post-colonial criticism and asks if those who have it hardest, people at the bottom or \"subaltern\" can really articulate their own lives at all within systems of knowledge and understanding that are so laden with colonial influences and patriarchal biases that they skew this process. She argues that the very frameworks used to \"give voice\" to the subaltern often reproduce the mechanisms of silencing they seek to dismantle. This contradiction really digs deep into how presentations and power are entwined when people like Western intellectuals, even when they mean well, often just speak up for people of lower status rather than letting those lower status people speak for themselves (Spivak 1988). Spivak&rsquo;s theory is particularly significant within the African context, where the aftermath of colonial rule continues to shape knowledge production, cultural expression, and socio-political structures. Postcolonial storytelling in Africa gets heavily shaped through lenses of the West, whether they are academic, literary, those of the media or related to politics. This is risky because it heaps these stories back into those colonial hierarchies (Mbembe 2001). Spivak's warning against epistemic violence the obliteration of indigenous knowledge and agency through colonial discourses resonates deeply in this setting. Even scholarship by people who study postcolonial culture, which should be the most nuanced and critical, can sometimes ignore the voices of those at the bottom by forcing overly broad frameworks from the outside that do not respect local specifics and needs (Smith,2012). In this light, Spivak&rsquo;s work challenges scholars and practitioners to engage with issues of positionality, that is the recognition of one's own social and epistemological standpoint when engaging with marginalized communities. Her call for a decolonized praxis involves foregrounding indigenous forms of knowledge and agency without appropriating or distorting them through dominant interpretive lenses (Spivak, 1999). This approach is especially relevant today to African groups aiming to recover and reclaim their identity through local languages, old ways and practices, oral storytelling and performing and visual arts. These initiatives aim to reclaim cultural autonomy and resist Western narratives that dominate and impose a one-size fits all approach (Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, 1986).</p>\n<p>Spivak&rsquo;s approach integrates intensely with feminist theory and decolonization theory and offers an analysis of oppression that looks at it from different and multiple angles. She puts a spotlight on the very special place that women occupy who are doubly unheard women who are silenced by both colonial structures and patriarchal ones. In doing this Spivak (1988) also critiques the romanticizing of agency and warns about taking for granted, that just because something is talked about a lot so readily that everyone knows and sees it, it automatically means it is empowering and everybody is benefiting. In Africa, the stories of women during the time before and after independence are perhaps the most complex and difficult. Women have often ended up getting left aside when nationalist movements and development stories are told like being the invisible girl at the end of the line. (Mohanty 2003). Spivak&rsquo;s insights encourage a more nuanced understanding of African women's resistance not as grand political gestures but as subtle, everyday acts of survival and cultural assertion that often go unnoticed in dominant historical accounts.<br /> Ultimately Spivak's contributions also encourage us to rethink how scholars, activists and institutions engage speaking power with people on the margins. Instead of trying to speak for the historically marginalized folks lets work on setting up conditions under which marginalized people can express themselves clearly according to how they see and feel things themselves. In Africa post the end of colonial rule, it really focuses on centering local ways of thinking, embracing different languages a lot and creating spaces where local folks are actually telling their own stories to define themselves. Spivak thus provides a critical lens for assessing the ethical dimensions of representation and the ongoing struggle to recover subaltern agency in the wake of colonial disruption.</p>\n<p>Inconclusion Gayatri Spivak&rsquo;s work forces us to pause and rethink how we engage marginalized voices especially in postcolonial African settings. She exposes how representations and epistemic violence fail to uplift intent silencing the very people they seek to uplift. Positionality, indigenous knowledge and the ability to speak in subaltern terms are all important considerations in Spivak's framework for ethical scholarship and activism. Her insights are still necessary to reclaim cultural agency and recast African identities and histories for the seldom heard.</p>\n<p><br />Methodology<br /> This research uses a qualitative approach, which is well-suited for exploring cultural topics and understanding how music can reflect deeper social and political meanings. Instead of focusing on numbers or statistics, this method helps us interpret messages, emotions, and ideas especially when looking at music and identity. This research uses Fela Kuti as a case study to take a closer look at how Afrobeat became a tool for resistance and cultural expression in postcolonial Nigeria. By focusing on his music, this research examines how Fela used his art to challenge political systems and inspire a sense of African pride and identity. To do this, the project involves analysing Fela&rsquo;s lyrics. This would help us understand the messages behind his work and how they connect to the broader issues in Nigerian society at the time. The analysis is guided by postcolonial and critical race theories, which help explain how colonial history continues to affect identity and culture today. These frameworks allow us to see how Fela&rsquo;s music pushed back against oppression and offered a new way for Nigerians to see themselves outside of colonial influence. In short, this method helps uncover how Fela Kuti&rsquo;s Afrobeat wasn&rsquo;t just music it was a powerful form of protest and a way to reclaim African identity in a changing world.<br />Textual Analysis<br /> This part of the research will focus on analyzing the lyrics from some of Fela Kuti&rsquo;s most powerful songs: \"Zombie,\" \"Sorrow, Tears, and Blood,&rdquo; &ldquo;Coffin For The Head Of State&rdquo; and \"Colonial Mentality\" . These songs were chosen because they directly address political and social issues in Nigeria, especially the impact of colonialism and the rise of military rule.<br />The analysis will look closely at the words Fela uses in these songs to understand the deeper messages behind them. His lyrics are rich with meaning, often filled with criticism of the government, police, and military. Fela didn&rsquo;t just sing for entertainment he used music to speak out against injustice and to make people think. Key themes that will be explored include resistance to oppression, the emotional and physical impact of violence, and the loss of cultural identity under colonial influence. This research will also pay attention to how Fela used tools like metaphor, repetition, and simple but powerful language to get his message across. For example, in \"Zombie,\" he compares soldiers to mindless zombies to highlight how they blindly follow orders without thinking for themselves. By breaking down these lyrics and understanding the context in which they were written, the analysis will show how Fela used his music to create strong political messages and to inspire people to question authority and reclaim their cultural identity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />Historical Contextualization<br /> To fully understand Fela Kuti&rsquo;s music, it&rsquo;s important to look at the time and place in which it was created. This part of the research will explore the historical and political background of Nigeria, especially after the country gained independence from British colonial rule in 1960. After independence, Nigeria faced many challenges, including unstable governments, corruption, and military takeovers. The military ruled for many years, often using violence and fear to stay in power. At the same time, although colonialism had officially ended, Western countries and companies still had a strong influence over Nigeria&rsquo;s economy and politics, a situation often described as neocolonialism. By examining this history, this research will show how Fela&rsquo;s music was a direct response to the events happening around him. His songs didn&rsquo;t just reflect what was going on they challenged it through his lyrics, he called out government leaders, criticized police brutality, and questioned the lasting effects of colonial thinking in Nigerian society. This historical perspective helps us see Fela&rsquo;s music as more than just entertainment. It was a form of resistance a way for him to speak out and encourage others to do the same. By placing his work in the context of Nigeria&rsquo;s political struggles, we can better understand the powerful role his music played in shaping public opinion and pushing for change.</p>\n<p><br />Cultural Analysis<br /> Alongside looking at Fela Kuti&rsquo;s lyrics, this research will also explore the cultural side of his music especially the unique style and sound of Afrobeat. This means paying attention to how the music was made and performed, not just what was being said. Afrobeat is more than just a music genre it&rsquo;s a mix of different influences that reflect both African traditions and global sounds. This analysis will look at key elements like instrumentation such as drums, horns, and guitars, rhythm which were often inspired by traditional African beats, and performance styles including Fela&rsquo;s energetic stage presence and long, improvised songs. These features gave Afrobeat a sound that was deeply African but also fresh and modern. Language is another important part of this cultural analysis. Fela often sang in Pidgin English and Yoruba, two languages that many Nigerians understand. This choice made his music more relatable and inclusive, especially for everyday people. It also served as a form of cultural pride choosing local languages over English was a way of rejecting colonial influence and embracing African identity.<br /> Afrobeat also blends traditional African music with Western styles like jazz and funk, creating a powerful mix that speaks to both heritage and change. By combining these elements, Fela used Afrobeat not just to entertain but to reclaim African culture celebrating what colonialism tried to erase. Through this cultural lens, this study shows how Afrobeat became a form of expression, pride, and resistance, allowing people to connect with their roots while also challenging the systems that tried to silence them.</p>\n<p><br />Theoretical Justification<br /> This research is based on postcolonial theory and critical race theory, two powerful ways of understanding how history, power, and identity are connected especially in countries that were once colonized, like Nigeria. Postcolonial theory helps us look at how the effects of colonialism didn&rsquo;t simply end when the colonizers left. Instead, the systems, attitudes, and cultural influences of colonial rule often continue to shape people&rsquo;s lives long after independence. This research draws on key thinkers like Frantz Fanon, who explored how colonized people struggle with identity and self-worth; Edward Said, who explained how the West has often portrayed non-Western cultures as inferior or &ldquo;other&rdquo;; and Homi Bhabha, who looked at how colonized people resist domination by creating new, hybrid cultural identities. By using these theories, this research can explore how Fela Kuti&rsquo;s music pushes back against those lingering colonial ideas. His work doesn&rsquo;t just entertain it challenges power, reclaims pride in African identity, and reshapes how people see themselves and their culture. Alongside postcolonial theory, this research also uses critical race theory to better understand how race, culture, and power are connected in Nigeria&rsquo;s post-independence society. Even after colonialism officially ended, racial and cultural hierarchies often remained. Critical race theory helps unpack how these systems affect everything from politics to music, and why reclaiming African voices and experiences through art is such a powerful act. Together, these theories give the study the tools it needs to examine how Fela&rsquo;s music breaks down old colonial ideas and builds something new and unapologetically African voice that speaks truth to power through rhythm, lyrics, and performance.</p>\n<p>Ethical Considerations<br /> When studying topics related to colonialism and African identity, it&rsquo;s important to approach the research with sensitivity and respect. This project is aware of the ethical responsibilities that come with studying a culture and history shaped by oppression and resistance.<br />One key idea that guides this study comes from scholar Gayatri Spivak, who talks about the importance of not \"speaking for\" people who have been historically silenced or marginalized what she calls the subaltern. Instead of trying to explain Fela Kuti&rsquo;s message from an outsider&rsquo;s point of view, this study will focus on letting Fela speak for himself through his own words with his lyrics. The goal is to understand what he was trying to say, rather than forcing a new meaning onto his work. The study also takes care not to exoticize African culture or treat Fela&rsquo;s activism as something distant or unusual. Afrobeat and the resistance behind it are deeply rooted in real experiences, struggles, and histories. It&rsquo;s important not to romanticize or simplify those realities for the sake of academic analysis.<br /> In addition, this research will be mindful of cultural appropriation, avoiding any use of African music or culture that strips it from its original meaning or community. Instead, the project aims to honor the context in which Fela created his music highlighting the voices, issues, and movements that shaped it. Overall, the study is committed to being respectful, accurate, and responsible in the way it represents Fela Kuti&rsquo;s legacy and the broader African struggle against colonial and neocolonial systems.</p>\n<p>Main aim: To explore how colonialism influenced African cultural identity and to examine how Fela Kuti&rsquo;s Afrobeat music and activism functioned as a form of resistance that helped reshape postcolonial Nigerian identity.</p>\n<p>Objectives:<br />&bull; To analyze how Fela Kuti&rsquo;s Afrobeat music and activism challenged both colonial legacies and neocolonial systems of power.<br />&bull; To explore the significance of cultural resistance in postcolonial Nigeria, especially through music as a platform for social change and political activism.<br />&bull; To evaluate the lasting influence of Fela Kuti&rsquo;s work on Nigerian identity and contemporary cultural movements.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br /> Main Research Question:<br />How did Fela Kuti&rsquo;s Afrobeat music serve as a tool for resisting colonial and neocolonial oppression, and in what ways did it contribute to the reshaping of Nigerian cultural identity in the postcolonial era?</p>\n<p><br />Research design</p>\n<p>This study is backing up by a qualitative approach since it offers the best means of analyzing how Fela Kuti used activism and music to protect African cultural identity while opposing colonial powers. Textual analysis and cultural analysis are two of the primary research approaches utilized for data collection and analysis methods. Using textual analysis, the lyrics of a few selected songs \"Zombie,\" \"Sorrow, Tears, and Blood,\" , &ldquo;Coffin For The Head Of State&rdquo; and \"Colonial Mentality\" that are significant to Fela Kuti's political criticism and cultural activity will be critically studied. These songs are not only artistic creations but also reflect and question the sociopolitical realities of postcolonial Nigeria. Cultural analysis will be used to analyze not only the lyrics of Afrobeat but also its use of traditional African rhythms, jazz and funk fusion, performative elements, linguistic choices, and instrumentation. By studying Kuti's music, one may see how, in reaction to Western cultural domination and his music promoted African identity restoration and cultural resistance. <br /> To place Kuti's music within Nigeria's post-independence era particularly during periods of military control, political upheaval, and neocolonial economic pressures, the study also makes use of historical contextualization. The research will use both primary sources alongside secondary sources as data collection methods. The collection of primary data includes song lyrics along with recordings of live shows and direct recordings of Kuti as well as original archival records. The research uses academic journal articles together with books on postcolonial theory and African music, documentaries, biographies and news items as secondary documentation. A better comprehension of Fela Kuti's work becomes possible through combining information from multiple data sources which enhance the analysis of his work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Research Design and Outline<br />The research design follows a case study approach, structured through several phases to systematically address the research questions and objectives:</p>\n<p>1. Literature review and field mapping<br />Reviewing academic works on postcolonial theory, critical race theory, African cultural identity, and music as resistance was part of this first stage. This method revealed a few gaps, including the absence of a thorough examination of the political and cultural influence of Afrobeat through the lens of postcolonial theory. The understudied relationship between music, decolonial theory, and African identity creation was also made clear by the literature review. This contributed to the development of the theoretical frameworks that were employed in this research, which mainly drew from the writings of critical race theorists including, Homi Bhabha, Edward Said, Frantz Fanon, and Gayatri Spivak.</p>\n<p>2. Selection of case study and justification<br />Fela Kuti was selected as the case study because of his status as the forerunner of Afrobeat and his continuous use of music as a vehicle for cultural reclamation and political protest. His personal life, songs, and live performances all demonstrate a deep interest in the effects of colonialism and the fight for African identity and independence. His work directly addresses the research topics and is consistent with the ideas and concepts discussed in the literature study. Kuti's whole career is based on critique, resistance, and the idea of an African identity that has been liberated, in contrast to many singers who just touch on politics in passing. His groundbreaking musically, his work is rich in ideology and provides profound insights into the structural and psychological effects of colonialism.<br /> Additionally, Kuti's selection immediately advances the objectives of the field mapping and literature evaluation. The literature highlighted how crucial cultural production is to postcolonial countries and how art may be a decolonizing arena. It also demonstrated how music is frequently overlooked in scholarly discussions of postcolonial identity, which frequently center on literature or the visual arts. By showing how Afrobeat works as a powerful tool for identity reconstruction and cultural resistance, this project fills that gap.<br /> A thorough and comprehensive analysis of meaning, form, and context is also made possible by the case study's alignment with the approach of textual and cultural analysis. The project seeks to add a distinct viewpoint to the conversation on colonialism, identity, and cultural resistance by firmly establishing the analysis in both theory and lived historical reality.</p>\n<p><br />3. Textual analysis of selected songs<br />The songs \"Zombie,\" \"Sorrow, Tears, and Blood,\" &ldquo;Coffin For The Head Of State&rdquo; and \"Colonial Mentality\" will be thoroughly examined to analyze their language, tone, symbolism, substance, and political messages. These songs were chosen because they were thematically related to the research questions. For instance, \"Zombie\" criticizes military dictatorship and mindless obedience, \"Colonial Mentality\" tackles the colonial rule-induced inferiority complex head-on, and \"Sorrow, Tears, and Blood\" shows how dissent is violently suppressed. The analysis will show how Kuti exposed the socio-political effects of colonial legacies through music.</p>\n<p>4. Historical and cultural contextualization<br />The next step involves examining the sociopolitical backdrop of Nigeria in the 1970s and 1980s. This entails studying the effects of the Biafran War, the British colonial era, the independence process, and succeeding military governments. It is essential to comprehend these historical events to recognize the importance and urgency of Kuti's music. His songs were reactions to daily circumstances and group problems rather than coming about in a vacuum.</p>\n<p>5. Cultural analysis of Afrobeat <br />As a musical style, Afrobeat is more than just a combination of African rhythms, jazz, and funk; it's a cultural and political statement. The use of traditional instruments, ensemble arrangements, performative storytelling, and the integration of African languages particularly Yoruba and Pidgin English will all be studied in this phase to comprehend how Kuti created a uniquely African musical style that defied Western conventions and honored local identity.</p>\n<p>6. Theoretical application<br />Postcolonial and critical race theories will be used to interpret the findings from the textual and cultural analyses. Kuti's challenge to colonial narratives will be analyzed in relation to Spivak&rsquo;s concept of the \"subaltern,\" Said's criticism of Orientalism, and Bhabha's idea of hybridity. Critical race theory aids in examining how race and power dynamics influenced colonialism and its aftermath, especially in terms of cultural expressions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />&emsp;<br />Historical and Political Context: Colonialism and Cultural Identity in Nigeria<br /> To understand Fela Kuti's music as political resistance and cultural activism, one must understand Nigerian colonial and postcolonial history. In Nigeria colonialism was a political and economic imposition, but also a cultural invasion that shaped systems of knowledge, identity and expression. Fela Kuti's cultural and political messages in Afrobeat are rooted in this historical context and act as both a critique and a cultural reclamation.</p>\n<p>Britain officially began the colonization of Nigeria in the late 1800s and finally succeeded in 1914 by merging the northern and southern protectorates. After this colonial project came British legal, educational, religious and bureaucratic systems. These systems were intended to replace African systems of governance, spirituality and cultural life. As theorized by Fanon (1968), colonialism operates through material domination as well as psychological and cultural alienation, separating colonized peoples from their history and self-conception. The erosion of Indigenous languages and oral traditions were among the most destructive effects of colonialism in Nigeria. The language of power, education, and opportunity was marginalized. The West discarded African knowledge systems as outdated and promoted Eurocentric histories, ideologies, and values. As a result, many Nigerians developed a strong cultural inferiority complex and internalized colonial superiority. In 1960, Nigeria became independent with hopes of sovereignty and self-direction, but the postcolonial period demonstrated how political independence did not necessarily entail cultural or economic freedom. Like Kwame Nkrumah (1965) had warned in his writings on neocolonialism, former colonial powers retained control through multinational corporations, foreign aid dependency, and structural economic models imposed by institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. Colonialism and postcolonial experiences have produced what Ngugi wa Thiong'o calls a \"cultural bomb\" where we see people abandoning their own culture for Western norms. This manifested in a growing cultural alienation in Nigeria, particularly among urban centers, where Western dress, religion, media, and values were seen as modern and traditional practices as outdated. Ngugi wa Thiong'o (1986).</p>\n<p>There were several military coups, political instability and widespread corruption in Nigeria in the 1970s and 1980s respectively. These leaders usually followed colonial patterns: centralized power, authoritarianism and suppression of dissent rather than creating systems rooted in African democratic traditions. The state increasingly aligned itself with elite and foreign interests, leaving the masses disillusioned and excluded from the promises of independence. Fela Kuti emerged as a revolutionary voice challenging both colonial remnants and military regime corruption in Nigeria with the use of Afrobeat music in the 1970s. His critique was twofold: On one hand he condemned the internalization of Western norms as in \"Colonial Mentality\" and on the other he exposed the neocolonial puppetry of Nigerian elites for foreign interests (\"Zombie,\" \"Sorrow, Tears, and Blood\"). Fela's activism was about recovering African identity, singing in Pidgin for the masses he also used Yoruba proverbs, rhythms and traditional instruments. His rejection of Western religion and acceptance of traditional Yoruba spirituality was a political act of decolonizing the African mind. Fela lived during the post-civil war years 1967-1970 and under subsequent military dictatorships, speaking for the oppressed. His residence Kalakuta Republic was a place of resistance symbolically and literally against the state. His political worldview was also shaped by his mother, the anti-colonial feminist Funmilayo Ransom-Kuti, who ties his activism to a lineage of Nigerian resistance. In his music Fela criticized state violence and Western domination as well as imagined a decolonized cultural future. In doing so he agreed with theorists such as Fanon or Spivak that cultural identity must be reclaimed as a liberation tool.</p>\n<p>Cultural Analysis of Afrobeat<br /> Afrobeat as postcolonial cultural form requires the theory of hybridity proposed by Homi K Bhabha. Identity is not fixed, as Bhabha argues in (The Location of Culture, 1994) but formed in what he terms \"A Third space of enunciation\" - a place where cultures compete for and mix meanings. This space is exemplified by Afrobeat. They combine African rhythms like Yoruba percussion and call and response patterns with Western styles like jazz, funk and highlife to create something uniquely Nigerian but universally resonant. Fela Kuti did not merely imitate Western musical styles; he went beyond that. He appropriated them for African self-expression and resistance. Horn sections and improvisational structures in Afrobeat recall big bands of American jazz whereas the rhythmic grooves recall traditional Nigerian drumming patterns. In this fusion identity is negotiated in a form of cultural negotiation - what Bhabha (1994) calls \"the very cutting edge of translation and negotiation\" - outside of colonial binaries.</p>\n<p>Fela resists Western assimilation as much as uncritical traditionalism. He did not want a nostalgic return to the past but a critical reconfiguration of African identity in contemporary forms. He rejected Christianity and Islam, colonial imports, and engaged critically in Yoruba spirituality as well as pan-African ideas. For example, the creation of the Kalakuta Republic and the use of traditional titles like \"Chief Priest of Afrobeat\" show a desire to build new autonomous African spaces. In this tension between tradition and modernity hybridity becomes politically potent. By resisting binary identities colonizer versus colonized, modern versus primitive, Fela constructed a multilayered cultural identity that acknowledged colonialism without being defined by it. This is what Bhabha terms \"that interstitial space between fixed identifications\" where something new and resistant appears.</p>\n<p>The language used by Fela in his hybrid identity construction is one of the strongest called Pidgin. Unlike standard English which denotes colonial power and elitism, Pidgin is the common lingua franca spoken by the Nigerian masses. By choosing this medium Fela made his messages of resistance accessible to all, not just the educated few. This linguistic choice rejects colonial linguistic hierarchy and claims voice for the marginalized - a central concern in postcolonial/subaltern studies Spivak, (1988). In addition, Fela performed ritualistic political acts. Onstage he mixed music, dance, spoken word, satire and costume for multi-sensory experiences of defiance. In many modern performance contexts, he employed Yoruba aesthetics such as traditional body painting, chants and ceremonial droughting. Such acts of cultural remembrance in contemporary frameworks produce a hybrid performance space combining continuity and resistance.</p>\n<p>Afrobeat became more than a genre in Fela's hands; it was a philosophy. It became an identifier of postcolonial Nigerian identity. In a nation divided by ethnicity, colonial legacy and political instability, Afrobeat provided a local but global expression. This hybridity enabled it to address Nigerians as well as the wider Black diaspora. This hybridity thus becomes a kind of cultural agency for Afrobeat. As Fanon (1963) pointed out, national liberation requires reclaiming and reimagining culture. This is best illustrated in Fela's Afrobeat which rejects colonial mimicry for cultural essentialism. It's a dynamic practice rooted in multiple traditions without being dominated by anyone. This in turn breaks colonial narratives that cast African culture as static, tribal or inferior. It demonstrates how cultural production within the postcolonial world may be dynamic, critical, politically engaged. Fela's Afrobeat demonstrates what Bhabha (1994) calls the productive potential of hybridity - a space in which new forms of identity can be imagined and acted upon.</p>\n<p><br />Textual Analysis<br /> This section provides a thorough analysis of the information gathered from a textual analysis of four of Fela Kuti's songs: \"Zombie,\" \"Sorrow, Tears, and Blood,\" &ldquo;Coffin For The Head Of State&rdquo; and \"Colonial Mentality.\" This examines how these songs oppose militarism, colonial legacies, and the internalized psychological repercussions of colonization, drawing on postcolonial and critical race theories and how Afrobeat serves as a political discourse that aims to regain African cultural identity in addition to being an artistic form. The research question: To what extent did Fela Kuti's music reflect and resist the impact of colonialism on Nigerian cultural identity? is thus directly addressed in this section.</p>\n<p>1. &ldquo;Zombie&rdquo;- Music as resistance to Authoritarian and Colonial Legacy<br />Zombie released in 1976 is known as one of Fela Kuti's most controversial and politically charged songs. The word \"zombie\" metaphorically characterizes Nigerian soldiers as mindless subservient to military orders, emphasizing the military's ruthless repression and unthinking devotion under autocratic control. The dehumanization and mechanical character of military regimes are revealed using sarcasm and repeating directives, such as &ldquo;Attention, March, March, March&hellip; Turn right, Turn left.\" Fanon warning of this phenomena in The Wretched of the Earth, where newly independent African republics frequently reproduce colonial systems of brutality and control. From a postcolonial standpoint, the song criticizes the militarization of postcolonial Nigeria. In this instance, the military turns become a continuation of the colonial state, imposing oppression on behalf of the postcolonial elite rather than the colonizer. Additionally, Kuti portrays the song as an instrument of popular resistance by using Pidgin English, a language that is accessible to the everyone regardless of status or class. Through easily accessible, localized expression, it reclaims African voices and decentralizes the elite discourse. This is consistent with the \"cultural hybridity\" idea of Homi Bhabha, which holds that language and culture combine to create new forms of self-expression and resistance. The state's distrust of music as a tool for mobilization is reflected in the song's aftermath, resulting in attacks on Kuti's mother and raids on his Kalakuta Residence. By using the body and voice as instruments of insurgency, the song transcends simple criticism and turns into a direct challenge to power.</p>\n<p>4. &ldquo;Sorrow, Tears, and Blood&rdquo;- Historical Trauma and Collective Memory<br />Composed after the Kalakuta raid, \"Sorrow, Tears, and Blood\" releases in 1977 is a somber and powerful reflection on state violence. The devastating aftermath of the military strike on civilians is described in the lyrics, \"Everybody run, run, run / Everybody scatter, scatter / Some people lost some bread / Some people just die.\" Kuti embodies the collective trauma of repressed Nigerians by expressing grief and indignation in a serene yet haunting tone. By documenting events that the state may otherwise deny or erase, this song serves as an act of archival resistance. Kuti provides a voice to the voiceless victims of military brutality, drawing on Spivak's contention that the subaltern is frequently hushed. Thus, his music preserves collective memory through sound, acting as a counter-narrative to prevailing state histories. Although Kuti uses music as a nonviolent form of resistance, Fanon's notion that violence is the language of the oppressed is reflected here. The somber vocal delivery, mournful horn passages, and slow tempo evoke a traditional burial dirge, connecting contemporary political violence to more ancient African customs of grief and remembrance. This song illustrates how systemic violence is racialized and passed down from colonial regimes via the lens of critical race theory. The dominating structures militarized policing, censorship, and economic inequality remain in place even though they are no longer directly controlled by Europe. This continuity is revealed by Kuti's music, which also asks listeners to acknowledge the legacy of colonialism.</p>\n<p>3. &ldquo;Colonial Mentality&rdquo;- Psychological Colonization and identity Erosion<br />Colonial Mentality released in 1977 addresses one of the gravest effects of colonialism &ldquo;the internalization of inferiority by colonized peoples&rdquo;. Nigerians who bleach their skin, wear European clothes, or consider African customs outdated are among the people Kuti blames for rejecting their own culture in favor of Western values. \"Dem don't be slaves again,\" he sings saying they don&rsquo;t know themselves; they lack self-awareness. Frantz Fanon's notion of the \"colonized mind,\" which states that the oppressed start to hate their own culture and take on the oppressor's perspective is strongly supported by this song. Fanon mentions that a psychological rupture a total rejection of colonial identity structures must precede decolonization. Kuti makes a personal and national appeal to reject \"colonial mentality.\" He promotes cultural pride and resistance to assimilation by using music to decolonize the mind. This idea is reflected in his Afrobeat style, which rejects Western pop in favor of African instrumentation, polyrhythms, and Yoruba-inspired call-and-response structures. According to Bhabha&rsquo;s theory, this song also addresses the \"ambivalence\" of postcolonial identity, which is the tension between a desire for indigenous authenticity and awe of Western modernity. In his critique of this liminality, Kuti calls for an unadulterated acceptance of African identity. The internalized racism depicted in the song also echoes global patterns of white supremacy, where Western standards are created as superior, influencing not only economics and politics but also aesthetics, morals, and even self-worth, from a critical race theory point of view. This racialized mentality is challenged by Kuti's song, which uses art as reprogramming and education.</p>\n<p>4. &ldquo;Coffin For The Head Of State&rdquo;- Cultural Memory, Spiritual Protest, and Symbolism<br />&ldquo;Coffin For The Head Of State&rdquo; released in 1977 is one of Fela Kuti's most passionate critique of authority. The song describes his defiance in carrying a symbolic coffin to the army barracks after his mother was killed in the military's attack on his kalakuti residence in 1977. This act of resistance is symbolic, as is the coffin becomes a container for protest and sadness, turning individual loss into a collective political memory. By referencing Yoruba spiritual traditions, the song turns protest into ritual. Here Kuti links the Yoruba cosmology of ancestors' demands for justice with a postcolonial critique of the Nigerian government. It also criticizes religion as hypocritical. Kuti shows how the moral precepts of Islam and Christianity contradict the deeds of rulers who use religion to justify oppression. This corresponds to Spivak's epistemic violence theory: indigenous knowledge systems and moral frameworks are suppressed by colonial and postcolonial authorities in favor of foreign ideologies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />To What Extent Has the Research Question Been Answered?<br /> This work demonstrates this by explaining how colonial structures in education, religion, and governance imposed western norms and eroded indigenous systems to form the basis of Fela&rsquo;s resistance. The work also mentions Kwame Nkrumah&rsquo;s concept of neocolonialism and Nigeria&rsquo;s post-independence crises (IMF/World Bank control, and corruption) as examples of how Fela&rsquo;s critique extended beyond colonialism into neocolonial systems. How he uses songs like &ldquo;Zombie&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sorrows, Tears, and Blood&rdquo;, &ldquo;Colonial Mentality&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Coffin For The Head Of State`&rdquo; as responses to internal and external oppression. This work also employs Bhabha&rsquo;s theory of the Third Space to show how Afrobeat is not a return to the past or a blind adoption of the Westh but a negotiation of identity through fusion. By using Pidgin and Yoruba in opposition to colonial language, Fela recovered the voice of the Nigerian masses echoing Spivak&rsquo;s notion of the subaltern speaking. This work also demonstrates how Fela used ritual, traditional symbols, chants, satire and dance to reconnect with and reinterpret indigenous aesthetics in a contemporary setting. This work argues that Afrobeat was more than a genre it was a symbol of postcolonial Nigerian identity rooted in resistance and celebration of African creativity. <br /> Analysing these four songs shows how Fela Kuti&rsquo;s music resisted colonial legacies and shaped Nigerian cultural identity. Post colonial struggles is represented in each song:<br />&ldquo;Zombie&rdquo; critics the replication of colonial violence by post-independence militarism.<br />&ldquo;Sorrows, Tears, and Blood&rdquo; remembers the states brutality and resistance.<br />&ldquo;Colonial Mentality&rdquo; addresses internalized oppression and cultural revival.<br />&ldquo;Coffin For the Head Of State&rdquo; combines ritual, grief and resistance for the symbolic protest of injustice.<br /> Together they constitute a multidimensional critique of colonialised legacy politically, psychologically, and culturally. They correspond tp the earlier literature Fanon and Bhabha&rsquo;s notion of cultural resistance and identity reconstruction. They conclude that Fela&rsquo;s music did not reflect societal issues only but was an active agent of public consciousness, solidarity, and decolonization. Thus, the research question: How did Fela Kuti&rsquo;s Afrobeat music serve as a tool for resisting colonial and neocolonial oppression, and in what ways did it contribute to the reshaping of Nigerian cultural identity in the postcolonial era? Has been answered. This work finds that Kuti&rsquo;s music responded to and critiqued colonial and neocolonial structures. He gave Nigerians a space to reclaim their identity, resist oppression and imagine a post-colonial future rooted in African traditions through new musical forms, radical lyrics and cultural pride.</p>\n<p>Conclusion <br /> This essay has examined how Fela Kuti's Afrobeat music critiqued colonial and neocolonial oppression and helped to reconstruct Nigerian cultural identity post-colonial. Informed by postcolonial theory, notably Fanon, Bhabha, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Nkrumah, and Spivak, it has been argued that Fela's music was a form of resistance. Songs like Zombie, Sorrow, Tears, and Blood, Colonial Mentality, and Coffin for Head of State demonstrate how Afrobeat could function as a weapon against military authoritarianism, cultural alienation, and foreign dominance. Fela used Pidgin, Yoruba spirituality, and performance aesthetics to regain indigenous identity in a new hybrid cultural space. Thus, Afrobeat was also a site of cultural resistance against Western hegemony while affirming African creativity and consciousness.<br /> Lastly, Kuti's work was a multidimensional response to colonial legacies - politically, psychologically and culturally. His music offered Nigerians a language of resistance, a mirror for societal critique, and a decolonized future. The struggle for postcolonial Nigeria also shaped its cultural and political identity.</p>",

This challenges the beliefs of many media scholars who predicted that the accelerated use and reliance on technology will alter our everyday lives and real-world hobbies, assumably for the worse. As a result, this study will use theories on the use of media, media ecology, and digital communities for theoretical context, while creating a new perspective on the enrichment of social media.<br />The hashtag \"#BookTok\" (an identifying hashtag for the online community of book lovers specifically on TikTok) grounds this study within technology, analysing online communities. The advent of social media in leisure reading will aim to answer how #BookTok has gained traction and influenced the physical book reader in the real world. To further support theoretical predictions and assumptions about communities and leisure reading, a survey will reveal what the community represents for its members, why they use it and in what way they have adapted its use in the real world, alongside perceptions of people outside of the community. <br />This dissertation identifies that the hobby of leisure reading is in its begging stages of a total eclipse online, where the #BookTok community is helping promote and enrich leisure reading, not undermining it, but making it seem desirable. Thus this dissertation piece will be a critique of the old and an insight into a new definition of leisure reading</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Introduction<br />&ldquo;The advent of social media in leisure reading&rdquo; is a dissertation aiming to present a shift in leisure time activities, identifying its newly adapted forms within the internet, through the example of the #BookTok community on TikTok. This topic is inspired by the countless theorists agreeing on a shift in society&rsquo;s traditions and roles as consumers as a result of increasing technological innovations, while identifying a gap for further investigation into its consequences, attempting to shine a positive angle on the role of media for individuals. <br />Theories on &lsquo;media ecology&rsquo; and &lsquo;acceleration society&rsquo; helped introduce this understanding of society&rsquo;s reliance on and the infiltration of technology, but not always positively: fearing that technology will consume too much of an individuals&rsquo; personhood. Instead, this dissertation implies technological determinism has inspired a natural human defense to adapt: simply migrating real-life activities into the online, maintaining individualism, just in a different space. <br />Exploring themes of technology&rsquo;s effects on individuals is best investigated through hobbies (being a highly personal choice). Those who fear technology&rsquo;s ability to change, often refer to the decreased reliance on print literature, demonstrate growing rates of aliterate individuals and increasingly digitally literate people. However, this dissertation finds that reading physical books has adapted into an online &lsquo;book club&rsquo; (Jerasa &amp; Boffone, 2021, p. 221) called BookTok, no longer reflecting the solely real-world activity described by scholars. <br />The focus of the research being &lsquo;how has accelerated culture impacted leisure reading?&rsquo; this dissertation hopes to prove the hypothesis that leisure reading has surged in popularity because of the technological presence of online communities like BookTok. This community presents evidence of society&rsquo;s recent developments within the internet, a precursor to what is to come and evidence against assumptions that reading&rsquo;s popularity will dwindle. Hoping to strengthen the argument that reading physical books has not intentionally lost its value and is in fact promoting leisure reading to even more people, a self-administered survey will question participants on their observations about reading as a hobby and their knowledge, consumption and reliance on the BookTok community. <br />To unveil the significance of BookTok, the dissertation&rsquo;s aims are to show how it disproves scholar&rsquo;s predictions, what it means for readers, what it implies for technology&rsquo;s usage and how it correlates still with the real-world. This shall be structured through a literature review of both the theoretical perspectives backing this argument, alongside the case study&rsquo;s analysis, with a discussion and review of the research method (exploring patterns, anomalies and differing perspectives among the respondents of the survey), followed by a conclusion summarizing the relevance this dissertation holds in conjunction with media theories. This research is important for opening avenues of thought for future scholars about positive implications, moreover, a push to abandon old notions that have long been surpassed by technology. Familiarizing this dissertation&rsquo;s readers with what is relevant now (by analyzing the community popularizing leisure reading), is the true intention of this study. <br />Literature Review<br />1. Theoretical Framework<br />Fundamental theories of media and its integration in society shall be presented within this half of the literature review to contextualize the current position society holds within technology. Peer reviewed literature and journal articles ranging from the 1980s to present-day capture the range of opinions surrounding technological developments and predictions of the future, shaping this dissertation&rsquo;s positive understanding of the technological present. In turn, aiding the hypothesis attempting to counterargue fears associated with technology. Identifiable themes of technology sparking cultural changes, as well as the rejection and fears accompanying the speed up of society, shall structure this chapter and establish a base on which the discussion of #BookTok as a method of adaptation of technology may build upon. <br />1.1 Society&rsquo;s percieved acceleration to the rhythms of life<br /> Most scholars equate the feeling of societal acceleration to an increase of technological innovations (Leccardi, 2003; Rosa, 2010; Toffler, 1980). A faster pace of life Leccardi (2003, p. 34) predicts, is proof that we are entering or rather already embracing a &ldquo;truly new societal model&rdquo;. Rosa (2010, p. 78) specifies the processes in which we may observe this speeding up: in the technological, economic, social, and cultural spheres. It has been demonstrated that through the access of life-simplifying measures, humans grow too used to its acquisition and require more simplification of services, thus creating the feeling of a sped-up society where more technology is developed, compromising the pleasure of the time it takes to complete these actions. This is supported by Leccardi&rsquo;s statement that there has been a &ldquo;demise of the experience of time around which modernity is structured&rdquo; (2003, p. 38) which is a direct result of instantaneous technological inventions. Prior to this, Toffler (1980) conceptualizes a timeline of events leading up to the so called &lsquo;third wave&rsquo;. The two prior waves were identified by the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution (1980, p. 26). He recognizes that the emerging revolution (the &ldquo;Third Wave&rdquo;) would be highly technological and anti-industrial, thus giving way to the \"prosumer\" economics of tomorrow (1980, p. 27). These are the conditions observed in the modern day which this study embraces. <br />A metaphorical analogy is used by two authors, expressing waves of change, whom both add to the analogy that they may overlap and collide and meet resistance or even partial reversals (Rosa, 2003; Toffler, 1980). Toffler and Rosa prematurely warn what technology&rsquo;s development may bring after analyzing previous &ldquo;wave&rdquo; structures. Rosa (2010, p. 13) states that &ldquo;acceleration might outpace our capacities for the successful integration of temporal experience&rdquo;, which envelops the argument of hyper-acceleration as not only an observation of the present but a possible warning to question its end. Rosa offers little solutions to the matter, rather prioritizing the explanation and definition of accelerated society. While Toffler on the other hand offers predictions and solutions (like political incentives and cultural changes). <br />Future scholars may wish to propose a resolution to fill the research gap of modern interpretations, while this dissertation is presenting another approach. Instead of categorizing social acceleration as innately damaging and with seemingly no end, this study presents a view of people&rsquo;s adaptation to the high speeds of today, initiating a discussion of an extended Third Wave, or even Fourth Wave, using what has already been observed by scholars. Individuals have found ways to use these inventions to help restyle their life to regain an element of slow culture, an example of which being the #BookTok community promoting or introducing the hobby of leisure reading as a method to regain consciousness in the shrunken temporal dimension. In the words of Toffler (1980): <br /> &ldquo;Millions are already attuning their lives to the rhythms of tomorrow. Others, terrified of the future, are engaged in a desperate, futile flight into the past and are trying to restore the dying world that gave them birth.&rdquo; (p.25)<br />1.2 Cultural impacts and changes of technology <br />This shift is acknowledged and later developed by media scholars, centralizing the notion that technological innovations &ldquo;extend human beings, human capabilities, and the human body&rdquo; (Strate, 2004, p. 7) which are concept relating to Media Ecology and Technological Determinism (TD), considering the relationship between technology and humans, much like this dissertation with hobbies. <br />Jan et al. (2020) find in this digital age, scholarly focus is on social media. Their analysis of key scholars concludes that TD assumes that &ldquo;ideologies, human communication behavior, teaching-learning settings, pastime and means of amusement&rdquo; have changed through our use of new technology (2020, p. 136). Confirming this digest, key contributor Postman (2000) introduced phrases like &lsquo;Media Ecology&rsquo;, metaphorically constructing Media as a petri dish which cultivates cultures, &ldquo;giving form to... politics, social organization, and habitual ways of thinking.&rdquo; (2000, p. 10). Hauer (2017, p. 3) furthers this view by identifying the so called &lsquo;new literacy&rsquo; of digital literacy as being an &ldquo;integral part of twenty first century man&rdquo;. This shall be used as proof of the thorough integration of technology by individuals and groups, already observed by scholars, to then offer an example of this unification through the #BookTok case study. This dissertation patches these premature predictions with a modern-day example, contributing to the TD field with an evaluation of how people have overcome this rapid change. <br />The Uses and Gratifications theory of Blumler and Katz will further shape analysis of the integration and cultural impact or technology because of its identification of why individuals choose to consume media. Katz et al. summarize scholar&rsquo;s attempts at defining media gratification in 1973, identifying that although each study created its own classification, compared to each other, they share similar categories of gratifications (1973, p. 512). Blumler and Katz proceeded to define their own research, identifying six true clusters of reasons children had for watching television: a Habit, for Arousal, for Companionship, to Relax, to Forget and to Pass Time (1974, p. 77). They critique their own findings, identifying it is a narrowed view of just the television medium, but scholars ought to examine these clusters among other media (1974, p. 89). As is attempted in this discussion of TikTok, these categories were asked of respondents in the survey (see Appendix 1), narrowed down to four classifications inspired by their findings: Diversion, Personal Relationship, Personal Identity and Surveillance. Attempting to analyze Uses and Gratifications within social media, may further explain which classification chosen feels a closer tie to online communities, and/or how different their experiences may be from what participants express their technological uses to be. <br />1.3 Rejection and Fears <br />Those also acknowledging the pace of life include Osbaldiston (2013) in &lsquo;Culture of the Slow&rsquo; as they explain that our lifestyles have become increasingly &ldquo;hectic, fast, complex and immediate&rdquo; (2013, p. 1). The premise of their book suggests a need to &lsquo;step back&rsquo; and &lsquo;slow down&rsquo;. This in turn will achieve a &ldquo;recapturing of the essence of &lsquo;real&rsquo; living&rdquo; (2013, p.1) and emphasizes scholarly thoughts that slowness reflects atypical norms of the current age, rather something &ldquo;synonymous with meaningfulness&rdquo; (2013, p. 5). As is reading, perhaps. <br />Wyatt untangles the notion that technological progress equals social progress (2008, p. 168), explaining that this view is &ldquo;misleading and dangerous&rdquo; (2008, p. 172). This derives from her analysis of technology and inventions as lacking space for human choice or intervention and more importantly the responsibility we assume over that what we make (2008, p. 169). Similarly, Castells characterizes the discourse around the developing technological revolution as &lsquo;prophetic&rsquo; and &lsquo;ideological manipulation&rsquo; (1996, p. 29). He interprets the hype and &ldquo;diffusion of technology&rdquo; as a reminder and amplifier of &ldquo;the power of technology&rdquo; (1996, p. 31); which he duly notes that its creation came about from the &ldquo;unique blending of military strategy, big science cooperation, technological entrepreneurship, and countercultural innovation&rdquo; (1996, p. 45) which is not heavily emphasized enough in his extract that it may be a cause of concern of its intended use. At the time of his writing, people treated Information technology as on par with the new sources of energy &ldquo;successive to the industrial revolutions&rdquo; (1996, p. 30). Adding to the emphasis of integration by noting that it is a &ldquo;constant background presence, the fabric of our lives.&rdquo; finalizing that &ldquo;We live with the media and by the media.&rdquo; (1996, p. 362). <br />What these authors have in common is the unquestioned notion that media surrounds us and has enveloped our everyday lives, acknowledged in this literature on a scale of how harshly it impacts society and therefore individuals. Despite the time of writing, Castells foresees that technology will be &ldquo;appropriated and redefined by its users&rdquo; (1996, p. 31), central to the framework of this dissertation and possibly the quote that further inspires this paper. This segways perfectly into the following section of the literature review that regards the case study of #BookTok and leisure reading. A rejection of the fast in admiration or even need for the slow accompanies the essence of reading books, being time-consuming! <br />2. Case Study <br />Now that key media theories to this study have been established, they must now be positioned with literature surrounding the case study. Two sections shall separate these secondary sources: the history and future of books and leisure reading, then an exploration of the TikTok community &lsquo;#BookTok&rsquo;. Sources span from 1984 up until present day, seemingly representative of the advent and current nature of technology and the internet. Although not particularly framed by the previously mentioned media theories, this dissertation finds the case study readings to identify acceleration society and moral panics surrounding the losing value of literature. Few of the early writers saw the possibility of adaptation to the high speeds of the internet, while more modern authors identified a shift. That research gap is being filled by this study with examples of this new mold. <br />2.1 Bookish history and predictions <br />First, using Daily (2018), we may define what a hobby is as it underpins the analysis of the technological change on an individual rather than a societal scale. Including reading, hobbies are &ldquo;beneficial leisure or non-work occupations&rdquo; (2018,p. 368) which people participate in because they are &ldquo;intrinsically rewarding&rdquo; (2018, p. 371). Boorstin (1984) does well to explain the importance books hold and have held in our societies; reminding the reader that religions use books as sacred texts (also in reference to the Gutenberg Bible- a significant first step for print literature), education relies on them as does politics as a source of knowledge, faith, morality, philosophy and history (1984, p. 11). However, in modern times book prices have risen, and libraries are closing. <br />In the same breadth authors acknowledge and warn about changing reliance on these books as a result of technological innovations (Birkerts, 1996; Knulst and Kraaykamp, 1998; Knulst and van den Broek, 2003). Birkerts identifies that the process of transmitting information is shifting from mechanical to circuit- driven, from page to screen (1996, p. 212). Instead of philosophizing we are more interested in managing the overload of information (Birkerts, 1996, p. 213). Knulst and Kraaykamp (1998) find that the sheer amount and accessibility of reading materials has harmed its appreciation. It now competes with the television (1998, p. 21) as well as the lack of time in daily life and increasing number of leisure alternatives (1998, p. 32). Knulst and van den Broek (2003) quantified that 49% of the population read books once a week in 1975, dropping to just 31% in 2000 (2003, p. 219). These factors position technology as the book&rsquo;s enemy, also implied but not specified by scholars of the previous chapter. These predictions shall be compared with findings of this study, to disprove the age-old argument that too much technology is negatively impacting individuals. <br />Despite the opposition, scholars have proposed alternative takes on this &ldquo;imminent disappearance of the book&rdquo; (Maziarczyk, 2022, p.109), the narrative this dissertation follows: a belief of a positive future alongside technology. Books and screens are not natural enemies explains Maziarczyk (2022, p. 111), rather complementary. New literacy must be understood away from its association with reading print novels (2022, p. 111) as it is entering another stage entirely. #BookTok is an example of a new mode and new literary expression, differing from in-person book clubs and other social media sites bookish community attempts. <br />Chamberlain (2012) acknowledges a shift in readers requirements, accrediting it to the new publishing eco-system, where book sellers and authors have taken advantage of the online (2012, p. 58), and undoubtedly the audiences it attracts. Even earlier analysis of Boorstin in 1984 identifies a habit of writing &ldquo;premature obituaries&rdquo; (1984, p. 11), criticizing those who predicted a fall or disappearance in leisure reading. His argument pertains to the traditional book lacking the novelty and commercial hype that technology has (1984, p. 23). This is the natural progression and migration referenced within the introduction observed by this study. Books and publishers must adapt to the new technological world or &lsquo;Third Wave&rsquo;, to withstand faster moving requirements of consumers. Therefore, weaknesses of the opposing team prove a lack of perspective and dangerous assumptions that all traditional modes and functions shall remain. The computer actually facilitates book reading and writing (1984, p. 28), therefore requiring computer literacy, which Boorstin uncovers as the new avenue to knowledge that print media once maintained; furthering the argument that technology has shifted our social systems thus requiring the letting-go of old ones. This perspective, presented through #BookTok and its association with an important and existing societal function (imagination/ entertainment and the maintenance/ protection of knowledge), finally proposes an evaluation of the technological effects scholars diligently warned us of. <br />2.2 #BookTok case study <br />Social media has become an &ldquo;integral aspect of individuals' everyday routines&rdquo; Ridzuan and Ahmadrashidi (2023, p. 75) rightly observe. Tik Tok being one of the leading apps, finding success with Gen Z because of its &ldquo;messy, chaotic, campy, and genuine&rdquo; aesthetic (Jerasa &amp; Boffone, 2021, p. 220) which had only entered the U.S. market in August 2018 and has only grown in users, viewers and creators since. Currently standing at over one billion downloads in the Play Store. Furthermore, scholars (Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi, 2023; Jerasa &amp; Boffone, 2021) identify subcultures/ virtual communities appertaining to interests and hobbies emerging within mediums like TikTok, nurturing a tailor-made experience. A popular example being BookTok, the TikTok subculture (and hashtag) Jerasa &amp; Boffone (2021, p. 219) refer to as enthusiastic about &ldquo;reading and discussing (mostly) young adult literature&rdquo;, a &ldquo;space created by youth for youth&rdquo; (2021, p. 220), but also a space connecting authors, publishers, and readers (Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi, 2023, p. 75). <br />Before there was BookTok, there were book blogs in the 1990s to early 2000s, that developed into the book vlog (video log) like BookTube on YouTube, then Bookstagram on Instagram, and now #BookTok on TikTok (Low et al., 2023, p. 5), emerging as early as March 2020. Dezuanni et al&rsquo;s. (2022) list of content this hashtag showcases, ranges from &ldquo;book reviews, &lsquo;shelfies&rsquo;, book cover reveals, recommendations, unboxing videos, critiques of controversial content, trends, as well as TBRs (to-be-read piles of books).&rdquo; (2022, p. 356). Those micro-celebrities who produce the videos pay significant attention towards curating an &ldquo;emotional or intimate connection with their followers.&rdquo; (2022, p. 370). This indicates a community not solely driven by the profits it creates (Reddan et al., 2024, p. 18), but the exposure to literary culture and leisure reading it generates. <br />This group of young readers online has &ldquo;revitalized the popularity of reading for a new generation&rdquo; claims James (2022, p. 2), sharing sentiments with Dezuanni et al. (2022, p. 371) as well as Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi (2023, p. 80) as it is &ldquo;nurturing a vibrant literary culture&rdquo;. This is the evidence presented throughout this study as a telltale sign of our already developed migration, not as a forced alienation due to the speed of production and consumption, but a willingness to connect with even more people to share hobbies. Statistics presented by Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi (2023, p.76) signify a &ldquo;significant alteration in reading patterns&rdquo; showing that between 2020 and 2021, BookTok inspired a &ldquo;70% increase in reading engagement&rdquo; which is not surprising when the hashtag has &ldquo;over 47.7 B views&rdquo; (2022, p.356) according to Dezuanni et al. in 2022. <br />To summarize, using Reddan et al., consumption of social media is growing in importance for readers (2024, p. 15), although it is important to note that not all use social media (representative of the survey findings). The &lsquo;BookTok phenomenon&rsquo; (Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi, 2023, p. 75) is widening horizons for publishers and authors to promote their products and collaborate with those right at the source of &ldquo;cultural authority&rdquo; (2024, p. 17) and therefore influencing participants of the BookTok community. Reddan et al. (2024) predicts, like this dissertation, that: <br />&ldquo;Social reading practices will continue to evolve alongside digital technologies. While the proliferation of bookish social media content indicates that readers will continue to engage with books and reading in digital spaces.&rdquo; (p. 79)<br />Utilizing the overview these scholars have made of the BookTok community has proven and presented the opinion of its do-gooding and establishment for the future. Without maybe realizing it, these scholars have aided in the works explaining TD and Media Ecology frames of the modern day, presenting TikTok as an app encompassing cultures and communities typically witnessed in social groups and after school clubs. A presentation of what the current stage of media is, in terms of embracing the fast life and changing it to fit around habits and slow culture hobbies is what this dissertation is defining. <br />Research Method<br />1. Research Question, Aims and Objectives <br /> Bornman (2009, p. 428) discusses the steps a researcher must take when conducting survey research, the first of which is to establish a research question and hypothesis. This study aims to answer the research question, &ldquo;How has accelerated culture impacted leisure reading ?&rdquo;. Now, in order to deliver a hypothesis, it is necessary to outline said objectives that inspired the question that frames this dissertation and the research method. <br /> These objectives are to find 1. the significance that the #BookTok community holds for those who read as a hobby; 2. disprove scholarly predictions that reading physical books will decline with the advent of digitization and technology; 3. explore the ways accelerated culture affects our leisure time activities; 4. present a correlation between #BookTok interaction and engagement with physical book consumption. <br />It is evident that these objectives stem and develop from one another, with the intent to prove the advent of social media&rsquo;s presence in offline, real-life hobbies. The hypothesis, therefore, is that leisure reading has surged in popularity because of the technological presence of online communities like #BookTok. <br />2. Research Design, Outline and Ethics<br /> In an attempt to answer the research question, this subheading will discuss the research method used to prove the above-mentioned hypothesis and to provide adequate evidence for the dissertation. This study examines the technological undertakings of hobbies and the way in which offline activities are being projected into online spaces. To study social practices requires qualitative research from the social sphere itself. Webb et al. (2015, p. 91) refer to this type of method as one that can provide rich descriptions of people&rsquo;s feelings and experiences. As a result, the qualitative approach will be the most adequate in giving insight into the community and their thoughts. Additionally, Berger (2000, p. 173) notes, &ldquo;content analysis itself provides no direct data about the nature of the communicator, audience, or effect&rdquo;. To gather information relating to the significance of the #BookTok community, surveys will be the best method to ask both qualitative questions and gather empirical data.<br />To answer the aims, the target population was strategically aimed at internet users (by distributing it mostly online, requiring internet access) as insider knowledge of the community will be valuable alongside outsider knowledge. If this survey was targeted at just those members of the community, answers would be biased and unrepresentative of leisure readers. Not all readers use social media or dictate their next reads based on #BookTok reviews but may reveal that online content influences offline life (like bookstores creating sections dedicated to TikTok recommendations). Likewise, non-readers are not inclined to be part of #BookTok but will have heard of it or perhaps stumbled upon it&rsquo;s more aesthetically pleasing videos rather than book content. Samples therefore were gathered mostly through social media platforms and student forums with a QR code (also to generate the largest number of responses)- still generating a mixed pool of readers and non-readers. But a partial bias towards a student population must be acknowledged at hindering broader responses, despite their differing opinions. <br />Kayam &amp; Hirsch (2012, p. 57) propose that social media networks &ldquo;can and should be viewed as the potential way of reaching participants in social studies research&rdquo;. Due to the nature of this study and the advice of Kayam &amp; Hirsch (2012), a self-administered survey will be used. This survey is defined as a questionnaire given directly to participants to complete themselves (Bornman, 2009, p. 449) and described as a &ldquo;very personal research method&rdquo; (Bornman, 2009, p. 427). Advantages include minimal costs and time saving (Kayam &amp; Hirsch, 2012) alongside those outlined in Figure 1. Concerns for this survey include participation rates needed to gain a representative set of data and misunderstanding of questions. These should largely be avoided through distribution efforts, being both online and offline, and using simple language, avoiding jargon and opening a line of communication for asking questions. <br />Ethical concerns are at a minimum; Along with the granted and approved Ethics Certificate, this research complies with the ten standards of American Psychological Association (APA) code of ethics which include competence, privacy and confidentiality as well as record keeping (Cherry, 2024). No personal data is shared in the data collection process aside from the answers given, all evidence was kept in a secure folder and destroyed a year after its collection, there are no triggering topics, consent is available to be withdrawn, and the research does not target vulnerable groups. However, required access to the internet to answer the survey may exclude certain participants.<br />The survey was conducted using Google Forms for simplicity and accessibility. This proved particularly beneficial as it held zero costs for its use, is available to anyone with internet access and has no limitations on the respondent amount. Kayam and Hirsch (2012) add that the security level can be adjusted (like the removal of sharing personal information such as emails), and participant answers were recorded &ldquo;automatically into a spreadsheet associated with Google Documents.&rdquo; (2012, p. 62). <br />The survey used for this dissertation (seen in Appendix 1) is &ldquo;reproducible and generalizable&rdquo; (Lai &amp; To, 2015, p. 141) because of its questions and Google Forms format. This is to allow for the collection, analysis, and longitudinal monitoring of information regarding #BookTok and leisure reading trends, explain Lai &amp; To (2015, p. 141); which in turn can be used to analyze shifts, which is the intention set by this study: to allow future scholars to use this study for evidence and to extend their own beliefs towards the rise of leisure reading or technology&rsquo;s benefits among individuals. Therefore, this method is best suited for this dissertation for its exploration of respondent&rsquo;s opinions and present day observations.<br />Figure 1<br />Advantages and Disadvantages of self-administered surveys <br />Note. Adapted from Bornman (2009, pp. 449 &ndash; 450).&emsp;<br />Research Analysis<br />1. Quantitative Survey Analysis</p>\n<p>Figure 2<br />Quantitative Table Key</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&emsp;<br />As evidence that supports the hypothesis and aims of the dissertation as a whole, this analysis chapter will discuss the answers provided from the self-administered survey (see Appendix 1). A separation of the Quantitative and the Qualitative data shall paint a picture of the variables one may assume when participating in the BookTok community, why they engage and who does not, as well as some interesting anomalies. Respondents will be referred to by number in the chronological order in which the survey was answered; identified by &lsquo;R&rsquo; to mean respondent like &lsquo;R1&rsquo; for Respondent 1. <br />The quantitative data analyzed within the study were separated by the types of questions asked that produced easy numerical results, like the difference between yes and no answers. Of the seventeen questions asked (excluding the question for consent at the beginning of the survey), nine questions were deemed appropriate for statistical evaluation. This data helped position who these respondents were and their standing with, or distance from the online community BookTok. Evidence was compiled in Table 1, shown above. The column headings (horizontal) indicate survey questions (summarized into a singular word or phrase). While the row header (vertical) classified the 25 respondents. Although not a statistically representative cross-section of society, results showed diverse, individualistic opinions and expected ratios of difference. Three types of respondents emerged at first glance, summarized in Figure 2 (the key) and highlighted across the table for visual correlation. <br />The results from Question 1 in Table 1 demonstrate that 72% of respondents classified themselves as readers, versus 28% that were not. Majority of respondents judged themselves as a number 4 on the scale of &lsquo;not reading very often&rsquo; (being 1) and &lsquo;reading very often&rsquo; (being 5) in Question 2. Although the question was up to interpretation by the respondents and this could not evaluate who and what they judge as &ldquo;often&rdquo; or not, &ldquo;not reading very often&rdquo; (chosen by 24% of respondents) was the second most popular choice. This is a reoccurring binary within these findings: being a somewhat regular and involved reader versus hardly at all. <br />Contrary to the volume of leisure reading participants, when asked one of the dissertations aims, if they believed there has been a decline in reading since the development of the internet (Question 12), a majority (16/25) observed a decline. As referenced in the literature review, several scholars (Birkerts, 1996; Knulst and Kraaykamp, 1998; Knulst and van den Broek, 2003) expressed a decline in a need for books or it being in competition with other entertainment technologies or simply too overwhelmed with choice. Therefore, this survey is consistent with previous scholarly literature, although outdated. More recent studies discuss the need to evaluate the decline in reading in alternative ways (Chamberlain, 2012; Maziarczyk, 2022). The answer &lsquo;Maybe&rsquo; was selected seven times; this is undefined and again interpreted by the participants but is evidence towards a contemplation between the decline or a recent increase. Yet again aiding this dissertation with evidence of a changing narrative towards literature online, despite only two participants voting for &lsquo;no&rsquo; decline. <br />Considering BookTok is on TikTok, it was imperative to analyze who could have access to the community. As such, Question 3 research finds that 84% (21/25) R currently have and use TikTok. Of the 21 R, 17 knew of BookTok and 5 did not; 4 of which were not readers to begin with (LB team) which was unsurprising. However an exception occurred in the LB team with R20, who knew of BookTok, having &ldquo;seen their videos&rdquo;. In contrast, R18, a reader, with TikTok, was the only one who hadn&rsquo;t heard of BookTok (of the16 readers who had TikTok and knew of BookTok). Furthermore, a reader (R13), without TikTok (B group) had still heard of BookTok through &ldquo;word of mouth&rdquo;. Although the majority matched expectations in their predisposition towards the community, the two anomalies who still knew of BookTok are unsurprising as the internet is spread far and wide and touches even those who do not participate with it, also proof of the community&rsquo;s popularity outside of the internet. <br />A test was conducted on the frequency of BookTok videos appearing on respondents For-You-Pages (FYP) in Question 16, revealing the relevance that these videos have on individual's social media. Of the Magenta group, 6/8 experienced anywhere between 0-5 videos on their FYP within five minutes, while only two had 6 videos or more. 10 people, not in the Magenta or Blue group (13 altogether) shared 0-1 videos of BookTok, as expected. And yet, there is an inconsistency in who feels part of the community. Only 8/25 are part of BookTok as opposed to the other 9 respondents who knew of BookTok. R9 answered independently, explaining that they &ldquo;interact with the community's content, but does not search for it&rdquo;. This may be testament to the already expressed notion that these questions are largely for interpretation, others may share R9&rsquo;s sentiments but would rather define themselves as not part of the community, despite coming across their videos (actively, although not consciously participating in them). <br />Asking how influenced (1 being never influenced and 5 being very influenced) they were to purchase books recommended by BookTok, Question 14 revealed stereotypical answers (condensed into Figure 3). Unsurprisingly M group and a new group (of readers using TikTok but not part of BookTok) kept to the highest-to-middle ends of the scale, like the binary B and LB groups who were at the lowest and least influenced end. <br />The Uses and Gratifications theory&rsquo;s categories for consumption was directly asked as a multiple-choice question for participants to reveal why they are compelled to use social media (specifically TikTok), linking to the backbone of this dissertation. A pattern emerged in Question 4: the most popular answer for TikTok users (8/21) selected only Diversion, with 5/21 selecting both Diversion and Surveillance. These R are most interested in escapism and/or obtaining information. The least picked category was for Personal Identity (3/21), a statistic that was not expected in a study on the popularity and effects of an online community. This may be rectified by the 5/21 people who considered Personal Relationships as a motivation, maintained and nurtured within BookTok perhaps for reading groups of people. <br />Figure 3<br />Summary of answers from Question 14 in the survey</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&emsp;<br />2. Qualitative Survey Analysis <br />Unsurprisingly, identical binary groups were found among the qualitative answers within the survey. The Light Blue and Magenta team (Figure 2) remain relevant in this analysis, however, one more group emerged among the readers (briefly identified in Figure 3) who did not feel part of BookTok (identified as the Orange group). Their perspective is useful when determining what individuals constitute as being part of the case study and position the current popularity of the studied community, helping future scholars predict its development. These responses shall be examined alongside the previously mentioned literature and theories to further prove the research question. <br />2.1 What do you know about BookTok? <br />Question 6 asked what the non-readers assumed the community was. Interestingly more than one respondent (R2, R8, R10, R16) identified the community as a &ldquo;place&rdquo; or &ldquo;side&rdquo; of TikTok. Examples include: &ldquo;a social place where you can read books&rdquo; (R16) and a &ldquo;side of TikTok where people enjoy reading and discussing books&rdquo; (R10). LB respondents correspond BookTok with the discussion of books. This closely relates to Postman (2000) and his introduction to the Media Ecology framework. He expands the &ldquo;global village&rdquo; metaphor, expressing technology as emulating the feeling of a village (close-knit for example) on a grander, global scale: In the same way #BookTok demonstrates a village within the online world. Further emulating Postman&rsquo;s notion that media &ldquo;gives form to a culture&rsquo;s politics, social organization, and habitual ways of thinking.&rdquo; (Postman, 2000, p.10), the online community experiences social hierarchies (such as greater or lesser followers), and controversies (like disagreeing opinions and divided preferences) as well as a shared language or abbreviations (like &lsquo;TBR&rsquo; for To Be Read). <br />Both Magenta and Orange define BookTok in Question 8 as a &ldquo;community&rdquo; known for its &lsquo;book recommendations and reviews&rsquo; (R1,3,4,5,7,9,13,17,23,25). Whom most interact with its content through likes, comments, saving, and sharing/ reposting, answered in Question 10; these are typical of the features utilized within TikTok to distribute content to friends and followers, and inform the algorithm of one's interests (Reddan et al., 2024, p. 5). R19 (although in the Orange group) expressed this deliberate action to recall content by liking videos &ldquo;in hopes to be recommended with further books&rdquo;, possibly acknowledging that other R do so subconsciously. It further illustrates that the Orange group enjoy the BookTok content but lack the feeling of integration within the community. The requirements needed to feel integrated have not yet been studied and are not answered by this dissertation and could be a suggestion for future scholars to develop.<br />2.2 Usefulness and Importance of BookTok <br />Regardless of its newness, BookTok serves as a &ldquo;convenient and effective platform for both readers and marketers alike&rdquo; (Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi, 2023, p. 79) and its outlook is &ldquo;undeniably positive&rdquo; (Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi, 2023, p. 81). Question 11 asked R on their views of the importance BookTok has in promoting leisure reading. The LB group members, although not part of, nor having heard of the community before, acknowledge it as a &ldquo;modern spotlight on the world of books&rdquo; (says R11) and providing &ldquo;role models&rdquo; (R10). M and O group share an attitude of BookTok&rsquo;s role in spreading interest in reading, as they are &ldquo;trend setters&rdquo; (R1) and portraying it as a &ldquo;welcoming hobby&rdquo; (R6) as well as aiding in the &ldquo;pivotal resurgence of reading&rdquo; (R7), &ldquo;sparking interest and discussion&rdquo; (R15). Its existence and potential outreach to non-readers can be credited to the role of the internet. The same way Jan et al. (2020, p, 134) summarize that mass media &ldquo;shapes attitudes and behavior of people and brings a revolution in the mode of operation of a social system.&rdquo;, this dissertation concludes that BookTok has adapted to the surge in technology, altering the space for a community of readers. Not all R shared this view, like O group R17, claiming the community &ldquo;targets already reading audiences&rdquo;. They perhaps do not observe chances for new readers to connect due to their heavily established colloquialisms and popular video topics (recommendations, hauls, bookshelf organization or fan theories). However, as the majority have shown, new readers fall into the community through simply coming across the videos and becoming more influenced to purchase books as a result. <br />Scholars (Low et al., 2023; Ridzuan and Ahmadrashidi, 2023) observe that it serves as a marketing space for publishers and authors. Respondents in the O team expressed a positive view on this use in Question 11: as &ldquo;important to small authors&rdquo; (R7) and &ldquo;marketing and targeting audiences&rdquo; (R13). On the other hand, two R in M group express its &ldquo;bias towards particular books&rdquo; (R25) and &ldquo;purposeful selection of books in book stores&rdquo; (R12), indicating a marketing ploy. This brings into question ideas within Uses and Gratifications: (U&amp;G) that despite a popular motivation for R being &lsquo;Diversion&rsquo; to use TikTok, the selling of a product or service is all the more prevalent (also answered in Question 14, evaluated in Figure 3 of their likelihood of being influenced to purchase items recommended). It should be noted that the original U&amp;G theory revolved around television and hadn't yet met the vast possibilities of the internet, suggesting the &lsquo;uses&rsquo; for media do not align with the content currently being produced. The global village is a perfect opportunity to sell products, especially with the growing \"prosumer economics of tomorrow&rdquo; that Toffler (1980) describes. Evidence of BookTok&rsquo;s involvement in prosumer-ism is already identified among studies (Dezuanni et al., 2022; Reddan et al., 2024) enquiring the BookTok phenomenon&rsquo;s ability to make a particular book popular, sought out and even sold out. Monetary gain remains persistent as does &ldquo;attention economy&rdquo; among social media content, explains Reddan et al. (2024, p. 17), but disputes the assumption with evidence from interviews conducted with bookish creators who failed to identify &ldquo;income or monetary gain as a motivation for creating content&rdquo; (2024, p. 18). Instead &ldquo;authenticity and community are important norms shaping the content and commercial environment&rdquo; (2024, p. 17). Books naturally pick up popularity when placed in a community of like-minded people who understand the needs and satisfaction required of other readers, not necessarily to sell books, but to provide informed decisions before purchasing. <br />2.3 Decline or Resurgence in reading? <br />When asked if there has been a decline in reading physical books (Questions 12 and 13), the 92% of respondents who answered &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;maybe&rsquo;, point out that reading is now accessible online through audiobooks and e-books (seen in R6,7,12,13,15,19,24,25 answers). Unified notions of &ldquo;shortening attention spans&rdquo; (R4) and &lsquo;hyper-focus on phones or the internet&rsquo; (R9,18,22) were described as additional causes, implying online reading as a replacement of traditional physical book reading. Hauer (2017, p. 3) extends &lsquo;new literacy&rsquo; (digital literacy) as being a large source of societal change, due to technological developments. This serves as proof of a shift for communities and their hobbies of interest, replacing physical social groups with &ldquo;hypertextual forms of communication and literary expression.&rdquo; (Maziarczyk, 2022, p. 109).<br />As the consumption of social media content of readers is becoming &ldquo;an increasingly important part of their digital lives&rdquo; (Reddan et al., 2024, p. 15) so too is the importance to re-analyze existing societal norms (Maziarczyk, 2022, p. 111). Question 15 asks R their observations relating to a resurgence or growth in leisure reading. LB group mostly observed &lsquo;no growth&rsquo; (predicably with their lack of association and integration with the hobby) offering little explanation why. O group and M group join in recognition of certain books growing in popularity, becoming more &ldquo;in demand&rdquo; (R9), &ldquo;selling out&rdquo; (R1,3,25) and acknowledge the &lsquo;phenomenon of books rising to fame&rsquo; (R15,24) with the help of BookTok. Also mentioning the &ldquo;acceptance&rdquo; (R4,) and trendiness/ popularity (R7,17) that reading now holds. These observations answer the Research Question: &ldquo;How has accelerated culture impacted leisure reading; exploring #BookTok&rsquo;s influence on physical book consumption?&rdquo;. Despite this new norm of reading being audiobooks or e-books, bookstores remain in business and even &ldquo;create #booktok displays in store&rdquo; (Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi, 2023, p. 80) proving a marriage between the online community and book club with offline, traditional consumption. <br />Limitations that may be acknowledged within this research method are the respondent rates and particular open-ended questions. The study is mathematically unrepresentative, and through the choice of distribution methods could have experienced a bias within results. Questions utilized in the survey largely aimed to generate qualitative results, but became too general, resulting in anomaly answers that couldn&rsquo;t be explained and short, vague responses. For future reference it would be useful to include more &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; questions for more detail. Overall, the answers presented form fitting stereotypes between readers and non-readers but allowed this study to deduce the popularity of BookTok and the shared or conflicting opinions its content or influence holds (answering both objectives 1 and 4).<br />Conclusion<br />Literature appreciation is deteriorating, some may say. This dissertation is a response to, and a rebut of those scholars who all too quickly judged the internet and easily assumed a position of negativity towards newer and faster developing technologies, for their imminent upheavals towards traditional printed books. <br />Knulst &amp; Kraaykamp (1998, pp. 32-39) offer a plethora of reasons for the decline of reading. They single out the increasing lack of time in daily life, increasing number of leisure alternatives, alongside a rivalry with television, as well as an increasing supply of reading matter which has &ldquo;harmed the appreciation of printed media&rdquo; (1998, p. 39). While Knulst and van den Broek (2003) blame the youths for &ldquo;an ageing interest and a stagnating inflow&rdquo; (2003, p. 223) as they grew up surrounded by television, having never been &ldquo;dependent on printed media&rdquo;, in turn acquiring &ldquo;less reading routine than those socialized before the era of television&rdquo; (2003, p. 225). <br />These &ldquo;premature obituaries&rdquo; (Boorstin, 1984, p. 11) written about books and our appreciation towards print literature reflect the fears surrounding technological development. Technology has been changing our uses and needs for things since its inception (like eBooks and audiobooks becoming the new norm, acknowledged in multiple survey responses). While some scholars believe it to be beneficial, others struggle to adapt their real-world habits onto the online. This dissertation was purposefully framed within the ideas of Technological determinism and Accelerated society to suggest the BookTok community emerged out of necessity and adaptation, to replace the old practices of reading - like technology replaced and improved on existing forms of work and labor within society to better suit this &lsquo;global village&rsquo; world.<br />Technological inventions have been created with the intention to simplify effort and multiply product need and consumption, while Strate (2004, p.7) sees it as an extension to human beings. Regardless of the effect technology stimulates, this dissertation believes society &ldquo;has to adjust and adapt to&rdquo; technology (Hauer, 2017, p. 1) because it has reconfigured the ways we &ldquo;create, distribute and evaluate knowledge, skills and information today&rdquo; (Hauer, 2017, p. 4). We are no longer suited to a non-technological life. This is the essence of the Media Ecology and Technological Determinist theories.<br />An irreversible change is described by Rosa (2003, p. 3) due to the speeding up of &ldquo;technological, economic, social, and cultural processes&rdquo; innovations have brought on. This in turn has sped up the temporal existence, delineating a new societal model called &ldquo;acceleration society&rdquo; (Leccardi, 2003, p. 34). This orders people to adapt and move with the new pace of &lsquo;time&rsquo; and existence or be left behind in the old world. Toffler (1980) highlights this era as &ldquo;the deepest social upheaval and creative restructuring of all time&rdquo;, the &lsquo;Third Wave&rsquo;, long passing the era of the industrial revolution. <br />Now, unlike the scholars fearing the internet&rsquo;s capacity for change, as a &lsquo;thief of time&rsquo; (Osbaldiston, 2013, p. 19), Boorstin (1984, p. 11) explains their fears as amounting to &ldquo;our speedy pace of change tempting us to imagine that new technology buries the old.&rdquo;. It is hard to imagine a world in which the simplification of life will maintain or nurture the values of the past. Osbaldiston (2013, p. 5) equates slowness as reflecting a style of living dislocated from the norms associated with fast capitalism. The limitations of this outlook, however, are its narrow-minded and traditional perceptions of what activities and time spending measures are considered valuable. Conversely, Reddan et al. (2024) acknowledges these values as simply experiencing a shift, into the global village. Book culture emerging online is understood as a &ldquo;process of adaptation&rdquo; (2024, p. 2) and will &ldquo;continue to evolve alongside digital technologies&rdquo; (2024, p. 79). Maziarczyk (2022, p. 111) suggests that we now require a new understanding of &ldquo;full-fledged literacy&rdquo; this can no longer be &ldquo;associated with reading print novels&rdquo;. <br />The dissertation acknowledges the #BookTok community as the new form and totally encompassing form of expression for leisure readers. Survey respondents reveal that being a reader is &ldquo;more accepted now, less shameful&rdquo; (claims R4), &ldquo;popular&rdquo; (R7) and &ldquo;trendy&rdquo; (R17). Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi (2023) identify its &ldquo;positive impacts on the literary community&rdquo; (2023, p. 78), &ldquo;nurturing a vibrant literary culture&rdquo; (2023, p. 80). Like James (2022, p.2), this dissertation shares the sentiment that &ldquo;despite dismal outlooks on the future of print books, a group of young readers online has revitalized the popularity of reading for a new generation.&rdquo;. It single-handedly sparked a 70% increase in reading engagement between 2020 and 2021 (Ridzuan &amp; Ahmadrashidi, 2023, p. 76). This confirms a desire for literature among the youths who are utilizing TikTok to promote their hobby further, disbanding earlier mentioned fears for the hobby&rsquo;s decay (answering objectives 1, 2 and 4). <br />Survey respondents revealed common standing assumptions that those not interested in books would not be aware of this online community, while readers are well aware of its existence and relevance for the publishing industry. However, almost all respondents with the app were aware of the community, having interacted with its content. This proves its modern relevance and overwhelming recognition. This study redefines the concepts relating to literature as an extension of Maziarczyk (2022) to argue that traditional notions and opinions have long since shifted into an online world. Not abandoning these values, rather adapting and transitioning into the new village. Having linked to theories of media, objective 3 is answered, identifying effects accelerated culture has made on leisure reading by explaining how people have now reacted to the predictions of scholars.<br />Disproving the negative assumptions of scholars with evidence from secondary literature surrounding BookTok, strengthens objective 2. The qualitative survey analyzed personal opinions about the community and its influence on the participant (readers or not), presenting binary views and yet stereotypical results, these answered objectives 1 and 4 by discovering its popularity and resonance with the reading community. <br />Achieving all four objectives, answers the overarching research question: &ldquo;how has accelerated culture impacted leisure reading?&rdquo;. Understanding the effects of technology on a society has been narrowed to an individual group (of readers) and analyzed through a media case study (BookTok), who&rsquo;s existence already proves a utilization of media for one&rsquo;s own benefit. This opens an avenue for media ecology scholars to explore the mass migration of communities and individuals towards the internet (identified within this study) and further define how one becomes part of these communities. Having analyzed BookTok, this dissertation reveals that a younger generation is intending to maintain the popularity of reading, that what was once percieved as the hub of maintaining knowledge and culture. They are doing so in a modernised way (through the internet and short-form video content) to better suit the needs of individuals today, as a result of accelerated society. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

This will be explored through the three following objectives (1) how have Gilmore Girls study motivation videos been interpreted by fans, (2) how have aspirational perspectives about education been shaped from the Gilmore Girls fan videos, (3) is there a Gilmore Girls fan editing community on TikTok. A sample of TikTok videos and comments of Gilmore Girls study content were analysed using discourse analysis. To explore how fan videos of Gilmore Girls shaped aspirational perceptions about education, through study motivation content. The purpose of the research was to explore how these fan videos can be interpreted to examine their meanings. To investigate the ways in which they convey aspirational perceptions. The significance of this research was to explore how the production of fan videos illustrates the reinterpretation of a context. To circulate a new meaning, which becomes a collective perspective. This is explained through the exploration of Gilmore Girls fan community by how they have encouraged study motivation. The findings from the research illustrate how the sample used in the research, revealed various categories of study videos. Within this genre of content and how the comments, which were taken from these videos, the three research aims outlined were demonstrated. Additionally, these findings support existing literature. As it builds approaches discussed and offers insights into the Gilmore Girls fan community on TikTok, by highlighting the topic of study motivation and exploring the study videos created and shared by the community. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Introduction <br />The dissertation investigates how TikTok fan videos of Gilmore Girls have shaped aspirational perspectives towards education by exploring study motivation content. TikTok&rsquo;s versatility of content creation and community space has arguably become a popular platform for creating and circulating fan videos. An example of this is the Gilmore Girls fan community, which will be the case study of this research. Gilmore Girls (2000- 2007) is a television series which has gained a large female fan base and despite premiering 25 years ago, the series remains popular on TikTok. Gilmore Girls is known for its recognisable dialogues, aesthetics and vocal discussions about the show by fans online. Study motivation content is one example of fan videos from the Gilmore Girls community on TikTok. These videos have generated interaction on TikTok, with various videos produced on this topic and regular comments from individuals expressing their opinions on these videos. <br />The research aims analysed these videos to explore how aspirational perceptions have been shaped. The fan videos analysed are based on study motivation, as the contents of these videos portray the notion of studying as a motivational activity. This has presented education as highly valued, encouraging fans to adopt aspirational perceptions of education through these study videos. Discourse analysis was used to understand how the influence of language can shape these perceptions. <br />It is important to explore text from videos and individual&rsquo;s comments to understand how the videos portray study motivation to answer the research objectives. Three objectives were used to conduct the research and analyse findings. These investigate how Gilmore Girls study motivation videos were received by fans, how aspirational perceptions about education were shaped and explores the fan editing community of Gilmore Girls on TikTok. <br />The dissertation will begin with a literature review discussion of existing perspectives, outlining the methodology of how the research will be conducted, followed by an analysis of results and a discussion interpreting the findings. Finally, a summary of the key findings of the research will be discussed in the conclusion. <br />Overview of context<br />Gilmore Girls follows the lives of the mother and daughter duo, Lorelai and Rory Gilmore. The series stands out as a &ldquo;woman-centric show,&rdquo; being based around the two female leads, who portray strong role models. Lorelai is estranged from her privileged upbringing and raised Rory alone as a teen mother. Although she faced challenges in her youth, she becomes a successful business owner, running an inn. Rory is portrayed as the studious daughter and a higher achiever, which gets her a place at a prestigious private school and Yale University. Peterson notes that watching Gilmore Girls offers an opportunity to balance the experiences of the characters against the viewers own experience (2018, p. 219). This view can explain why fans feel a sense of connection to Gilmore Girls. Through the representation of positive female characters, inspiring fans to engage with the series. The research will refer to the characters of Lorelai and Rory, with a clearer focus on Rory. As the fan videos are centred around her character, representing the value of education. <br />Literature Review<br />The literature review chapter examines scholarly perspectives to investigate how TikTok has become a central platform for fan production. Although fan editing has existed since the 1970s, this research will focus on the digital transition. By exploring social media and short-form content. The review will begin with discussing Coppa&rsquo;s foundational research on vidding. Providing a brief overview of its history and practices within fan communities, which are relevant to the objectives. As traditional and contemporary media intersect, a convergence culture has emerged. Impacting previous forms of fan interaction. The research by Jenkins on convergence culture, could be linked with the emergence of digital platforms. Through the argument that it has become easier to produce and share content. The connection between the production of fan content and digital platforms will be explored, by investigating TikTok&rsquo;s community for fan videos. The concepts of textual poachers and participatory culture are essential in the research. To understand the active participation of fans, and how they have created meanings of text. This will be followed by an overview of the factors that explain the predominance of females in fan communities. This was primarily discussed by Bacon-Smith. Moreover, the presence of female fan communities on TikTok will be explored, to expand on the research of the scholars discussed. This will demonstrate how these communities continue to thrive. In summary, the literature review will contribute to understanding the role of TikTok in shaping perceptions of educational values in fan videos. As this has outlined how theoretical perspectives will link to the case study, of Gilmore Girls fans and study videos on TikTok. <br />Vidding: History and Present<br />The practice of vidding refers to integrating elements of mass media in innovative ways. Vids are fan-made videos, editing preexisting clips from television or movies to music (Russo &amp; Coppa, 2012). Vidding has been practised in fan communities since the 1970s. Initially using film slides and gaining popularity with the era of videocassette recorders. This enabled vidders to use a larger archive of footage to create vids (Coppa, 2022, p. 7). The result of these vids is a new multimedia piece that tells a story, generates interpretations and evokes a feeling (Coppa, 2022, p. 23). Increased approaches to thinking and opportunities for collective expression are created through vidding (Coppa, 2022, p. 22). The engagement with vidding is still prevalent in fan editing today. Although the creation and distribution of vids have developed with the digital platforms. <br />TikTok and fan videos<br />According to Kułaga, TikTok has transformed visual communication and digital interaction (2024, p. 212). As the leading platform for short-form videos, TikTok enables users to engage in creative expression and community building (Zhu, 2023, p. 229). This has also meant the nature of vidding has advanced. TikTok is commonly used for producing content lasting a minute, while vids are three or four minutes long (Coppa, 2022, p. 18). This suggests the duration of fan videos are getting shorter with TikTok.<br />The description of vidding as outlined by Russo and Coppa (2012), can be applied to describe fan videos on TikTok. As creators produce fan videos by overlaying dialogue from television or movies. This demonstrates the new forms of creative expression, as stated by Jenkins (2009, p. 9). Kułaga emphasises how videos can resonate with fans, by conveying inspiring and compelling perceptions (Kułaga,2024, p. 220). TikTok supports content creation through the platform&rsquo;s built-in editing features and collection of various audio choices (Zulli &amp; Zulli, 2022, p. 1873), (Kułaga, 2024, p. 212). Therefore, simplifying the process of creating fan videos and generating content with more users. The virality culture on TikTok as observed by Zhu found that when an original video gains traction, a phenomenon occurs whereby countless imitation videos are published rapidly, covering a variety of genres on TikTok (Zhu, 2023, p. 230). Ciesielska et al also noted TikTok is full of impersonations and fanfiction readings, inspired by favoured stories and characters (Ciesielska et al, 2025, p. 7). This builds on the findings by Zhu further and implies this trend is also observable in fan videos. This demonstrates how TikTok has made creating and viewing content accessible to all users across the globe (Kułaga, 2024, p. 212). Therefore, this evidences the view that fandom has made a mark on mainstream digital culture, ideologies and lifestyles (Ciesielska et al, 2025, p. 7).<br />The shift to Digital and Convergence Culture <br />The digital revolution has impacted fandom by blurring the lines between producers and consumers (Pearson, 2010, p. 84). This statement is supported by Ciesielska et al, with the view that creating and disseminating content has been made easier with digital platforms (Ciesielska et al, 2025, p.13). Moreover, the rise of digital technologies has led to fandom growing &ldquo;exponentially&rdquo; (Ciesielska et al, 2025, p. 7). Transforming practices and the communities themselves, as stated by Russo and Coppa (2012). Consumers are enabled to appropriate and recirculate media content (Jenkins, 2006, p.1). As they have become &ldquo;empowered,&rdquo; with a bigger role in fan participation (Pearson, 2010, p. 84). <br />Convergence culture, as described by Jenkins is &ldquo;where old and new media collide&rdquo; (Jenkins, 2006, p. 270). Content flows across multiple media platforms and the &ldquo;migratory behaviour of audiences,&rdquo; means fans have coexisted with this shift, by also having a presence on these platforms (Jenkins, 2006, p. 2). The growth and flexibility of new media technologies and platforms meant media has gained a presence everywhere. Therefore, the way content is produced and consumed has altered, due to convergence (Jenkins, 2006, p. 16). Consumers can now use different technologies and platforms to interact with others. There is a &ldquo;freer flow of ideas&rdquo; and control of media under the consumers (Jenkins, 2006, p. 18). This means fan videos have now &ldquo;catapulted into mainstream consciousness&rdquo; according to Russo and Coppa (2012). This refers to how rapidly fan videos have gained attention. As fan videos have extended beyond the community itself and gained recognition from mainstream media. A range of participatory cultures occurs on social platforms including TikTok, as noted by Ciesielska et al (2025, p. 17). Content has become accessible across multiple platforms such as social media because of convergence culture (Jenkins, 2006, p. 254). <br />Textual Poachers, Participatory Culture and Active Fans <br />As established, fans not only consume media but are also producers. Lewis states fans are spectators who also participate through forms such as reading and writing (Lewis, 1992, p. 208). They constantly create a cultural environment, using the resources available to them (Lewis, 1992, p. 53). As we move away from a time which consisted of select producers while many consumed media, everyone now has a more active role in the culture that is produced (Jenkins, 2009, p. 12). Fans actively demonstrate their control over the mass-produced texts, which serve as a framework for their own cultural productions and social interactions. As a result, fans become active participants in the construction and circulation of textual meanings, rather than simply being spectators (Jenkins, 2013, p. 23).<br />Jenkins proposes the model of textual \"poaching\" to fans. This draws from De Certeau&rsquo;s association of poaching with popular reading. Poaching distinguishes the relationship between readers and writers, as a struggle to possess texts and control their meanings (Jenkins, 2013, p. 24). This analogy has been applied to fans, with the view that they also read and appropriate popular texts. The community of active and vocal consumers meant poaching has been &ldquo;developed as an art form&rdquo; (Jenkins, 2013, p. 27). Texts have been reinterpreted to serve different interests. As the spectators who watched television had transformed their experience into a participatory culture (Jenkins, 2013, p. 23).<br />Fandom here becomes a participatory culture which transforms the experience of media consumption into the production of new texts (Jenkins, 2013, p. 46). Participatory culture involves producing fan videos, mashups and other creative forms (Jenkins, 2009, p. 9). Popularising the term, Jenkins describes participatory culture as one with &ldquo;relatively low barriers to artistic expression&rdquo; (Jenkins, 2009, p. 5). The community provides strong motivations for sharing creative expression and active participation (Jenkins, 2009, p. 6).<br />Transformational Fandom<br />Correa-Ch&aacute;vez et al describe transformational fandom as &ldquo;the domain of creativity&rdquo; (2024, p. 530). With fans engaging in the reinterpretation or distortion of texts (Coppa, 2022, p.11). Women, queer individuals and people of colour are more likely to be transformational fans. On the contrary, heterosexual white men are part of the affirmational fandom, which celebrates texts without altering them (Coppa, 2022, p.12).<br />It is theorised that individuals from marginalised social groups have a greater motivation to transform texts than those from more privileged backgrounds (Correa-Ch&aacute;vez et al, 2024, p. 530). In the context that affirmational fans are the privileged group referred to here. Women and queer individuals within transformational fandom faced limitations including marginalisation (Coppa, 2022, p.14). These findings evidence transformational fandom is largely female dominated. This is further highlighted by Coppa, who states that a significant number of vids focused on representing marginalised female perspectives (Coppa, 2008). Furthermore, Jenkins also notes that fan writing is a primarily feminine response to mainstream media texts (Jenkins, 2006, p.43). This notion continues in the recent research by Correa-Ch&aacute;vez et al, indicating fanfiction remains perceived as a feminine activity (Correa-Ch&aacute;vez et al, 2024, p. 530). The findings of Coppa, Jenkins and Correa-Ch&aacute;vez et al demonstrate that transformational fandom is characterised by a female majority. This explains why this group of fandom is concerned with creating their own interpretation of texts. Bacon-Smith&rsquo;s research of female fan communities further examined this.<br />Female fans and TikTok communities<br />In her observational study, Bacon-Smith explored a predominately female fan community whose members participate in creating and sharing fan fiction. The research demonstrates how these women have engaged in fan communities as a response to their historical experiences of oppression. Women sought community ties in a &ldquo;fragmented world&rdquo; becoming part of fan communities as a &ldquo;safe harbour,&rdquo; against their struggles and reconstructing lost models (Bacon-Smith, 1992, p. 290). Jenkins expands on the findings of Bacon-Smith, noting many fans describe their entrance to fandom as a movement from the cultural and social isolation imposed on them as women in a patriarchal society, to a community in which they feel a sense of belonging (Jenkins, 2006, p.41). <br />Female media fans utilise television characters to begin narrating their own lives. Narrative gives the fundamental power to create reality. Communicating experiences with others in the community and eventually developing into a global perspective (Bacon-Smith, 1992, p. 292). Fan fiction conveys how women feel or relate in the community, as the writer is also a woman who shares the experience. The interaction and participation by fans strengthen the sense of a shared community. To form a distinct culture that is separate from masculine culture (Bacon-Smith, 1992, p. 296). Jenkins&rsquo; research on gendered writers is also relevant in this context as it indicates that women have invested more effort to understand character and storyline developments beyond textual boundaries. This practice is rooted in interpretive approaches more common with &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; perspectives rather than &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; (Jenkins, 2006, p.44). These perspectives demonstrate how women have created fan content utilising media centred around television characters.<br />Fan engagement through platforms like TikTok demonstrates how a female community continues to thrive, celebrating shared interests and values. According to Kennedy and Beffone, TikTok can be read as a &ldquo;celebration of girlhood&rdquo; (Kennedy, 2020, p. 1069), (Boffone, 2022, p. 40). Communities such as the primarily female &ldquo;BookTok&rdquo; unite literature fans revitalising the reading culture. This has marked a significant cultural transition which is driven by women (Teel &amp; Lund, 2024, p. 1102). Additionally, Boffone notes TikTok can become embedded into our personalities, with the opportunity of self-discovery. With the platform&rsquo;s educational and community-building aspect (Boffone, 2022, p.6). The application of television characters to construct narratives as highlighted by Bacon-Smith, along with the influence of personalities via TikTok as noted by Beffone. Demonstrates how this is still a relevant practice to shape meanings. <br />Summary and Research Gap<br />The literature review has evaluated various perspectives within the frameworks of fan studies and feminism. Discussing the works of key scholars which include Coppa, Jenkins, Lewis and Bacon-Smith. An analysis of TikTok and its role in relation to vidding has been explored. This has discussed the culture of fan videos in the digital age, through social media platforms. Platforms like TikTok, have made fan production and engagement easier this was explained through the concept of convergence culture. The concepts of textual poaching and participatory culture were discussed, to demonstrate how fans interact with texts. The act of constructing narratives through television characters illustrates how fan videos have employed the use of these characters, in a form of motivation. Therefore, the literature review has demonstrated the key foundational framework the research will be based on.<br />Despite this, the existing literature provides a general overview, but a lack of discussion regarding the various communities on TikTok, beyond BookTok. Another aspect I aim to expand on in the research, is how fan videos serve as a source of motivation and aspiration. To investigate how the Gilmore Girls fan community contributes to promoting the importance of education. The significance of the research is to explore the subject of fan communities further to focus on TikTok. Also to explore how they can shape perceptions. Additionally, to aim to analyse how visual media texts interprets context from the original source. This will include dialogue and quotes, which expands on solely the use of video clips or imagery in fan videos. <br />Methodology <br />The methodology chapter delves into a detailed discussion of how the research was conducted. Outlining the research design, methods and data collection. This chapter will also explain the rationale for the research choices.<br />Research question, aims and objectives<br />The research investigates how TikTok shaped aspirational perceptions about education from fan videos. Through the use of media from Gilmore Girls, for producing study motivational content. <br />This formed the question which will be investigated throughout the research:<br />&bull; How have TikTok fan videos of Gilmore Girls shaped perspectives towards education?</p>\n<p>The following objectives will assist with answering this question:<br />1. How have Gilmore Girls study motivation videos been interpreted by the fans? <br />2. How have aspirational perceptions about education been shaped from the Gilmore Girls fan videos? <br />3. Is there a Gilmore Girls fan editing community on TikTok? <br />Research method<br />The chosen method to conduct the research was discourse analysis. Discourse analysis examines opinions related to a particular area of social activity. As well as the shared beliefs or values surrounding it (Hart, 2020, p. 7). This is investigated through communicative forms such as speech, text and images. With the intention to explain how language becomes meaningful and unified (Berger, 2016, p. 249), (Hart, 2020, p. 8). Discourse analysis is an example of a qualitative method. This is effective for gaining and interpreting the opinions of individuals about a topic. Qualitative research considers the diversity of meanings created in media. Using language to understand concepts based on individuals&rsquo; experiences (Brennen, 2017, p. 5). This generates detail-oriented data with is useful to interpret in-depth discussions. <br />As the research analyses discourse on TikTok, it was also important to recognise some advantages of digital platforms when conducting discourse analysis. Digital means of discourse are viewed as an easier, convenient and faster form of communication. This also provides the opportunity to reach a wider audience. This has enabled individuals to convey their messages (Izotova et al, 2021, p. 198). Communication that occurs online also has more participants and information available, which is constantly accessible (Izotova et al, 2021, p. 202). <br />These points benefit the consumer of digital means. Also, from the position of a researcher, it reduces limitations to gathering data. Constant and easy access to a large sample size, will allow for the exploration of a wide range of content. While also decreasing the barriers concerned with accessibility. This provides the opportunity to understand perspectives from a larger group of individuals, resulting in greater representability in data. Therefore, this demonstrates the effectiveness of using discourse analysis for conducting this research. As this method enables detailed discussions and diminishes restrictions to data collection. This is relevant, as the research analysed content on TikTok. <br />Ethical considerations<br />As the videos were publicly available, issues regarding privacy are limited. However, as an additional measure, the videos chosen were ensured to have no mention of personal names and identifiable information. This was the case with the videos chosen and comments used. Therefore, the videos that were used in the research had usernames with an assortment of words and numbers rather than real names. Finally, the data collected is purely for research purposes and to support the investigation of the hypothesis. <br />Data collection <br />The process of conducting research involved observing fan videos of Gilmore Girls published by creators on TikTok. To restate the type of videos used, solely observed will be specific to the topic of study motivation. To interpret how this topic shapes perceptions about education. The case study revolves around the series of Gilmore Girls. Although it was not a requirement for all of the selected videos to have visual imagery from the series. This means, the sample also consisted of videos that have embedded dialogue or phrases from the series. The rationale behind this was to demonstrate how fans have interpreted the original source, as well as incorporating their own element of content creation. This was also significant to provide a connection to the literature discussed. Focusing on one case study is important to gain a deeper understanding of perspectives and focus on meanings. Especially for a niche group of individuals, such as TikTok&rsquo;s Gilmore Girls fan community. This also helped to make the research process manageable. <br />Gathering data<br />There were two parts to the data collection process. Firstly, a group of videos were selected which largely supported the research objectives of aspirational perceptions and study motivation. The criteria of these videos were to be short-form and include an aspect of audio or visual media from Gilmore Girls embedded in the video. The second portion of the research explored the comments. To investigate the community space of Gilmore Girls and what fans have gained from the videos. This process generated qualitative data, which was a useful approach to examining and interpreting the opinions of the members of this community.<br />With the intention of using contemporary examples of Gilmore Girls fan videos, the chosen videos were published between 2023 and 2024. This decision is based on the factor that numerous videos are shared on TikTok. The videos before this timeframe may lack relevance regarding the research objectives. Also, this was to have a manageable sample size of data.<br />Case study relevance and link to literature <br />A significant amount of screen time is dedicated Throughout the series, to represent places that an education setting is commonly associated with. From classrooms to libraries, schools and university, Gilmore Girls follows Rory&rsquo;s academic journey. She is frequently seen on screen, immersing herself in these environments. Which shapes her interest with academia. This description as noted by Diffrient and Lavery (2010, p. 188), demonstrates the relevance of the case study to the research. It also provides context into the fan videos that were analysed. The scenes that Diffrient and Lavery refer to have been used in the fan videos. This demonstrates the relevance of the community of Gilmore Girls fans on TikTok. Moreover, the research aims to highlight concepts discussed within the literature review. Referring mainly to the works of Bacon-Smith, Coppa and Jenkins. This includes exploring the concepts of participatory culture, textual poaching, reconstructing narrative and vidding. <br />Summary <br />This chapter has discussed how the research was conducted. Having outlined the research design and data collection process, the methodology chapter has demonstrated the relevance of using Gilmore Girls as the case study, and how findings were analysed. <br />The rationale for each decision in the research has been explained. Finally, the connection to the frameworks discussed in the literature review was demonstrated. <br />Analysis <br />Subject position in the research<br />Before presenting the findings, I will discuss my subject position in the research. From the position of observing Gilmore Girls fan videos and having watched the series. I was intrigued to explore how fans have expressed their views of the show on TikTok. Focusing on the context of study motivation videos. While Gilmore Girls fans have noted criticisms of the character of Rory Gilmore for a variety of events in the series, the idolisation of Rory for her academic personality is a popular narrative in the Gilmore Girls fan videos. Therefore, I wanted to investigate this narrative further, to explore how fans have expressed their motivations from these study videos. That revolves around Rory&rsquo;s work ethic and approach to education. <br />Overview of findings <br />The research analysed Gilmore Girls study videos published on TikTok between 2023 and 2024, this timeframe was established to keep the sample size manageable. Videos were chosen via search and recommendations, using phrases such as &ldquo;Gilmore Girls studying&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gilmore Girls study motivation,&rdquo; to generate results. This highlighted some of the popular videos about this topic, some of which received millions of views and interactions through likes, comments and shares. The research findings are categorised into two sections which support the research objectives. Section one will explore the view of empowering role models for education. This will be through analysing videos of study motivation. Followed by section two, which will demonstrate the community space of Gilmore Girls fans on TikTok. This refers to discussing the comment sections from the study videos. The rationale for the videos and comments referred to in this section can be found in the appendices. <br />Section One: Empowering role models for education<br />This section explores how study videos created about Gilmore Girls on TikTok can shape empowering perceptions for education. These videos were mainly focused on Rory Gilmore, which demonstrates how fans have adopted Rory as a role model for education. Empowered by Rory&rsquo;s passion for education, fans have created and shared videos about study motivation. This exploration found three distinct categories of Gilmore Girls study content. These categories include, study tips inspired by Rory&rsquo;s work ethic, fan edits using Gilmore Girls scenes, and creators&rsquo; interaction with Gilmore Girls media for their own study lives. All these categories demonstrate the motivation fans have gained by Rory&rsquo;s approach to education. <br />Category One: Study tips inspired by Rory&rsquo;s work ethic<br />This category demonstrates how fans have created study videos sharing their takeaways from Rory&rsquo;s work ethic. These are explored through videos that promote studying motivations using advice, study tips and promote additional engagement with the series. The figures describe how each specific video reflects the category.<br />Figure 1 <br />How to study like Rory. <br /> <br />Utilising TikTok&rsquo;s slideshow function for sharing images, Figure 1 demonstrates the creators list of recommended study tips inspired by Rory Gilmore. As you swipe through this video, each image provides descriptive advice for studying, using images of Rory in the background. The audio used in the video, is a dialogue taken from an episode of Downton Abbey, which is also used by many female creators on TikTok who film themselves studying. The audio states &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a woman with a brain and reasonable ability, stop whining and find something to do.&rdquo; The female community on TikTok have used this audio for motivation. This is also demonstrated in this video, as a source of motivation for education. <br />Figure 2<br />Rory Gilmore study tips.<br /> <br />Figure 2 consists of a montage with clips of Rory studying, as a list of study tips is displayed for the entire duration of the video. This creator has shared this video as advice to encourage the community to motivate each other to study.<br />Figure 3<br />Gilmore Girls study episodes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Similar to figure 1, figure 3 also uses TikTok&rsquo;s slideshow format to recommend episodes for study motivation. The text has outlined specific study episodes throughout the series, referencing its season and episode number. The image above is taken from the episode where Rory graduates from high school. This matches the context of this video. One of the viral Gilmore Girls audios on TikTok is used in this figure. The audio begins with a dialogue spoken between Rory and her mother Lorelai in the original series. This mentions Rory&rsquo;s well-known phrase, &ldquo;who cares if I&rsquo;m pretty if I fail my finals.&rdquo; This is then edited with Marina&rsquo;s song &lsquo;are you satisfied.&rsquo; With the mention of lyrics such as, &ldquo;high achiever,&rdquo; &ldquo;driven by the greed to succeed&rdquo; and &ldquo;nobody can stop me.&rdquo; This reflects the motivations of studying as well as Rory&rsquo;s academic persona. Particularly with the notion of being a high achiever for education, this describes Rory&rsquo;s personality in the series. The creator also references the dialogue, &ldquo;who cares if I&rsquo;m pretty if I fail my finals&rdquo; in the video&rsquo;s caption, which appears to be a popularly used phrase within the Gilmore Girls fan community. <br />Category Two: Fan edits using Gilmore Girls clips<br />The second category draws examples of how content from the series has been used for fan production. All videos are a form of montage, using clips from these series, as well as reflecting the creators&rsquo; own interpretations of the source. There are differences in editing styles in these videos. Through the incorporation of Gilmore Girls media, such as imagery, video and dialogues. <br />Figure 4<br />Rory Gilmore being my motivation for 1:46 straight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br /> <br />Figure 4 is a compilation of clips from the original show, which the creator has complied together. To share the specific scenes which has motivated them. The video gained a high number of interactions, evident in the 150,000 likes and 33,000 saves. This demonstrates a consensus of relatability with the viewers. <br />Figure 5 <br />Who cares if I'm pretty if I fail my finals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Figure 5 uses the same audio as figure 3, however this video is one of the original videos created from this audio. The video begins with inserting the original scene this audio has been taken from Gilmore Girls. This consists of a conversation between Rory and Lorelai. Who encourages Rory, who is stressed about her studies, to take a break. Lorelai advises Rory to sleep as a temporary distraction from her studies, as she states, &ldquo;you have to sleep it&rsquo;s what keeps you pretty.&rdquo; Rory, quickly responds with, &ldquo;who cares if I&rsquo;m pretty if I fail my finals.&rdquo; This conversation shifts to a video montage of study scenes of Rory throughout the series. Receiving over seven million views, figure 5 has become one of the most popular Gilmore Girls fan edits on TikTok. Fans are motivated by Rory&rsquo;s study mindset, dismissing the notion of appearance in favour of prioritising her education. The video is captioned with &ldquo;academic validation&rdquo; by the creator which also incorporates their perspective on this subject. <br />Figure 6<br />Rory Gilmore is a mindset.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This video represents a rapid style of editing on TikTok. Figure 6 is the shortest video in duration from the sample, lasting eight seconds long. The creator has combined scenes of Rory with images which capture a form of studying. Such as equipment, textbooks and other objects associated with education being framed in the shot. The text on screen states, &ldquo;step 1. If you wanna be Rory Gilmore, you have to think like Rory Gilmore&hellip; Rory Gilmore is a mindset.&rdquo; The creator has replaced the text on screen to &ldquo;Rory Gilmore.&rdquo; For reference, the original audio uses the same dialogue but refers to a social media personality, named &ldquo;Tara Yummy,&rdquo; which the creator has replaced Rory Gilmore for the context of this video. This video is part of a trend, which has accumulated 14,000 videos. Users have utilised the audio for various types of content, while this video has adopted a motivational approach. In addition, the caption provided relates to this explanation. As it states, &ldquo;study like Rory Gilmore and get grades like Rory.&rdquo;<br />Category Three: Creators interaction with Gilmore Girls media for their own study lives<br />The final category explored how fans have interacted with Gilmore Girls, focusing on individual creators. This is commonly seen through using dialogue and audio from the series or with embedded media, captions, or phrases written on screen. The following two figures demonstrate how fans have documented their study lives through vlog form content, inspired by the Gilmore Girls study related clips.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Figure 7 <br />Studying like Rory.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />In figure 7, the creator documents their study session reflecting their inspiration of Gilmore Girls with the use of the audio and text displayed, &ldquo;studying like rory.&rdquo; The audio consists of a conversation from the original show where Rory explains she is going to study before the &ldquo;food gets here&rdquo; (for context, in this scene the family was waiting for their food delivery order), where she dismisses herself from a conversation to prioritise her study tasks. Rory&rsquo;s father, Christopher then replies (To Rory&rsquo;s comment) saying &ldquo;what? tomorrow is Saturday.&rdquo; To which Rory explains how she plans to spend the weekend organising her school homework and other tasks. Christopher&rsquo;s response reflects the view shared by many people. Whereby Friday is associated with taking a break from other commitments. To which, Rory demonstrates a counter approach of this perspective, to utilise the weekend for further productivity. Although not all fans may agree this advice themselves, they have used this dialogue for study motivation content regardless. This is demonstrated by the caption embedded by the creator, &ldquo;rory gilmore mindset.&rdquo; This comments on their motivation by the character. As this dialogue ends, the audio cuts to a chorus from Sixpence None The Richer&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Kiss Me.&rdquo; This specific audio as implied by creators on TikTok, evokes a feeling of comfort. As in some of these videos, creators use low contrast lighting and objects to connect these atmospheres with the perception of studying as an example of a comforting activity. This creator illustrates this with the use of a table lamp and clips of busy roadways juxtaposed with the backdrop of the nighttime.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Figure 8 <br />This is your sign to start studying like Rory Gilmore.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Figure 8 follows a vlog form approach, in which the creator has documented their daily activities. The creator also has incorporated clips which consist of low contrast lighting and uses a candle, to evoke a comforting atmosphere. There is a variety of clips used which go beyond studying. One example of this includes the creator visiting a shopping centre. Figure 8 also uses the same audio as figure 7. However, this video has a more direct call of action to the audience. The video&rsquo;s focus is the text on screen, &ldquo;this is your sign to start studying like rory gilmore.&rdquo; As the creator encourages viewers to study by showcasing an aesthetic portrayal of their day as studying motivation.<br />Section Two: The community space of Gilmore Girls on TikTok<br />This section explores the opinions of Gilmore Girls study videos by analysing the comments sections. A sample of comments has been collected in which fans express the motivations they have taken from the study videos. The figures below represent the individuals&rsquo; viewpoints which will aid in understanding how these videos may shape perceptions. <br />Subsection One: Gilmore Girls TikTok fan community <br />The community space of TikTok is illustrated in figures 9 to 13. These figures match the space of community created, with fans sharing their views using vocabulary and emojis.<br />Figure 9<br />Comments from individuals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In figure 9 the individual has used emojis and capitalised words to share their appreciation specifically seen through the use of the word, &ldquo;love.&rdquo; This comment also received 256 likes implying this feeling with mutual with other fans.<br />Figure 10<br />Comments from individuals</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Figure 10 demonstrates the act of romanticisation with education, this reflects the fans idealisation towards their own education inspired Rory Gilmore and her approach to education. This opinion is shared by fans, as demonstrated by the 888 likes this has comment received.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Figure 11<br />Comments from individuals</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Figure 11 refers to TikTok&rsquo;s &ldquo;studytok&rdquo; community, which focuses on uniting study enthusiasts becoming a popular term used by individuals and creators. which demonstrates fans have classified Gilmore Girls study videos as part of this wider community based on the nature of these videos. This was one of the many comments that mention studytok when exploring the comment section. In addition, the comment received 15 replies reflecting the shared consensus of thought and wanting to belong in this community.<br />Figure 12 <br />Comments from individuals</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The individual notes their frequent engagement with similar content in figure 12, which implies these videos are well received by the members of the community and they are active.<br />Figure 13<br />Comments from individuals</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />Figure 13 reflects the appreciation of the video and demonstrates they have been inspired. The 111 likes also imply this view is shared with other fans.<br />Subsection Two: The aspiration role models the videos. <br />Fans have shared their motivation and inspiration of Rory Gilmore from these videos. This is reflected in figures 14 -17. <br />Figure 14<br />Comments from individuals</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Figure 14 demonstrates what the individual has gathered from the video. This notes how they have been motivated to educational achievement. Moreover, the comment received 786 likes which demonstrates this is a common thought among fans that interacted with the content. <br />Figure 15<br />Comments from individuals<br /> <br />Figure 15 outlines how the individual has been inspired by Rory to adopt this perspective as a mindset. As this comment received 346 likes it demonstrates the relatability of this approach by other fans.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />Figure 16<br />Comments from individuals<br /> <br />An example of fans expressing their inspiration of Rory specifically, is seen in figure 16. This individual shares how Rory become a role model for them. <br />Figure 17<br />Comments from individuals<br /> <br />Figure 17 demonstrates that Rory has been viewed as a role model for fans continuously and has inspired them to continue acting as a form of encouragement towards their academic goals. <br />Summary of findings<br />These findings have analysed a sample of the various study content created by fans including videos inspired by Rory&rsquo;s work ethic, using Gilmore Girls media for edits and how creators have incorporated Gilmore Girls in their own study sessions. Additionally, the comments explored how these study videos were received by the viewers leading to them being motivated to achieve their own educational goals. <br />Discussion <br />Restating hypothesis and objectives <br />The research investigated the connection between TikTok fan videos of Gilmore Girls and perspectives towards education. With the aim to explore how these videos shaped educational perspectives around studying through Gilmore Girls study fan videos. This hypothesis was analysed through a sample of fan videos relevant to study motivation and examining individuals&rsquo; perceptions from the comments section of these videos. <br />Summary of the findings<br />The findings were sectioned into two categories, which were empowering role models for education and the community space of Gilmore Girls on TikTok. Within these main categories, there were subsections. I will begin with discussing section one. The data found three distinctive categories, within the empowering role model section. These categories demonstrate themes of the Gilmore Girls study videos. These were study tips inspired by Rory, fan edits using Gilmore Girls content and the interactions with the series by creators in their studying lives. The second portion of the research focused on the community space of Gilmore Girls to explore individuals&rsquo; perspectives. This was also explained into two subsections: the aspiration role models the videos, which explored how fans were inspired by study videos, and exploring the community of TikTok&rsquo;s Gilmore Girls fans. These findings have supported the hypothesis, which will be discussed in this chapter.<br />Interpreting the findings<br />The key findings have been analysed by each research objective. This is to demonstrate, how the findings have supported the objective. <br />How were the Gilmore Girls study motivation content interpreted by fans? <br />This objective will discuss how study motivation videos were interpreted by fans. The analysed sample of videos were well-received by fans. As evident in the interaction of comments, likes and through the engagement of the viewers. The comments reflect how study motivation was interpreted. This is seen in figure 13, &ldquo;thanks for the motivation,&rdquo; and figure 16, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s (Rory Gilmore) so inspiring and motivating!! I love her so much!&rdquo; These figures highlight how fans have expressed their view on study motivation content. Therefore, this research objective has been met as indicated by the findings.<br />How have aspirational perceptions about education been shaped by Gilmore Girls fan videos?<br />The findings draw two explanations to how aspirational perceptions about education has been shaped by Gilmore Girls fan videos. These are by using narrative and more commonly, focusing on Rory Gilmore as a role model for approaching education. The outcome aligns with research conducted by Bacon-Smith, 1992, which explains the notion of female fans using television characters to narrate their lives (Bacon-Smith, 1992. P.292). This is illustrated in the findings as Gilmore Girls fans have reconstructed meaning from the series to serve as a new narrative which is used as a form of motivation to achieve their educational goals.<br />Aspirational perceptions<br />The perceptions of how these videos were shaped, is referred to as &lsquo;aspirational.&rsquo; Given the nature of these videos. As they as interpreted as encouraging individuals to strive towards academic success. The findings demonstrate how aspirational perceptions can be viewed from the video through figure 5, &ldquo;academic validation&rdquo; and figure 14 &ldquo;this year i can&rsquo;t wait to focus and get higher grades.&rdquo; The dialogue from the audio used in figure 3 also builds on this interpretation through the lyrics of &ldquo;high achiever,&rdquo; &ldquo;driven by the greed to succeed,&rdquo; &ldquo;nobody can stop me.&rdquo; These findings reflect how fan videos have shaped aspirational perspectives.<br />Rory Gilmore as a role modern for approaching education<br />The narrative of Rory as a role model is presented by the creators of the videos, observing the captions and wording of text used. Such as &ldquo;study like Rory Gilmore and get grades like Rory&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rory Gilmore is a mindset&rdquo; demonstrated in figure 6 and &ldquo;this is your sign to start studying like rory gilmore&rdquo; (figure 8). This shows how creators have shaped Rory as a form of motivation towards education. Moreover, the fans interactions with the videos demonstrate how they have accepted this narrative this is especially illustrated by &ldquo;Rory will always be my academic motivation&rdquo; in figure 17. These comments reflect how fans have been motivated to adopt an aspirational approach, through which they have centred Rory as the role model. Figure 10 solidifies this interpretation &ldquo;i love how everyone just loves studying when it&rsquo;s romantiasized by rory gilmore&rsquo;s lifestyle.&rdquo; This shows how the narrative has been accepted by fans. The outcome aligns with previous research conducted by Kennedy (2020). Who notes TikTok could be read as a &ldquo;celebration of girlhood&rdquo; (p. 1069). Through refers to the notion of female fan communities celebrating shared interests and values. This research is seen with the approach of Rory as a role model by fans.<br />Is there a Gilmore Girls fan community on TikTok? <br />The findings indicate there has been a fan editing community on TikTok, this is further emphasised by the comments. In figure 12, the individual notes &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find me in every Gilmore Girls video.&rdquo; This demonstrates the community has an active fan engagement. This is further highlighted by the interactions the videos received such as figure 5, which has accumulated over seven million views. Additionally, in figure 6 and 7 which received over two million and one million likes respectively. All videos analysed have received various interactions from fans such as comments and likes. This highlights the popularity of the community on TikTok. The example described by figure 12 reflects that a sense of belonging has been created. <br />Theoretical implications<br />Textual poachers <br />The findings reflect Jenkins&rsquo; concepts of textual poachers and participatory culture. The findings demonstrate how perceptions about education are shaped through the narrative of Rory as a role model. Encouraging aspirations related to academic achievement, through the circulation of study fan videos of Gilmore Girls. This finding reflects how fans have reconstructed the meaning of the original media text, which is the series of Gilmore Girls. By emphasising the significance of study motivation. Therefore, this explains how fans are active participants in the construction and circulation of textual meanings from a source. Rather than being a spectator, as noted by Jenkins (2013, p. 23). This demonstrates the active role the Gilmore Girls fan community has on TikTok towards consuming this perspective. <br />Participatory culture<br />Another framework the findings build upon is participatory culture. The findings demonstrate the active participation and form of expression by the creators who have produced the content to share the meanings. As well as the fans, who have interacted with the content. As a result, they have accepted the meanings. Therefore, this demonstrates how a participatory culture has been formed through the production of Gilmore Girls study videos. The research objective of exploring the fan community of Gilmore Girls on TikTok also reflects the relevance of this concept in the findings. This analysed the active interaction of these videos by fans.<br />Reconstructing narrative<br />The notion of female media fans utilising television characters to narrate their lives is a key argument in the findings. Fans have created study videos centred around Rory as a role model for approaching education. These videos have had an influence on shaping perspectives. This is demonstrated by the individuals&rsquo; comments, becoming a common theme in the findings. This indicates how this narrative has been developed as a wider perspective. <br />Vidding<br />As evident in the findings, the fans videos have generated interpretations and evoked perspectives. This links to the works of Coppa (2022, p. 22). In her research on vidding, Coppa explains the notion of increased opportunities to collective expression through vidding, this is demonstrated in the research through the narrative of Rory Gilmore as a role model for education. This view particularly aligns well with the reconstructing narrative concept explained by Bacon-Smith.<br />Limitations and recommendations<br />To build on this research, future findings could focus on observing the Gilmore Girls study community on other social platforms. Such as Instagram to explore how the content differs. This would expand the discussion and explore other perspectives from the content. Content shared on other platforms may indicate a different sample. For example, TikTok focuses on short-form videos, whereas Instagram may have a different approach and set of audience. This comparison could reveal another way study content is interpreted by fans. Given the timeframe and word count for this research, the findings are not representative of other social platforms. The research has also explored how TikTok as a social media platform specifically contributes to these perceptions. Therefore, this research could be used as a framework to explore how study content created by Gilmore Girls fans is either similar or different to TikTok.<br />Contributions <br />The main contributions of this research were investigating a niche community on TikTok to explore how they convey their perspectives, with the focus of study motivation content. The research has built upon existing theory to explore digital fan production and interaction, by exploring short-form content. The findings have demonstrated the connections to existing theoretical approaches seen by Bacon-Smith, Coppa and Jenkins.<br />Conclusion<br />The research investigated how study motivation videos of Gilmore Girls have shaped aspirational perspectives of education. All research objectives explored have been achieved. This has been demonstrated as the Gilmore Girls study motivation videos analysed in this research have demonstrated how they have shaped aspirational perspectives of education. This was further shown through the analysis and discussion of the findings. The research revealed how study motivation was interpreted by fans, through fan videos sharing advice and narrative. This was seen in the findings, which indicated how fan videos and comments have constructed the narrative of Rory Gilmore as a role model for education. This narrative was engaged with and accepted by fans, which signifies how meaning has been created. The literature discussed how the reinterpretation of a text, can portray a new meaning that can be circulated. This could become a collective perspective within the community. The demonstration of Gilmore Girls fans circulating a narrative of Rory Gilmore as a role model indicates this. This demonstrates how aspirational perspectives were shaped around study motivation. This was explained through the discourse analysis which found language of appraisal and motivation. This demonstrates how fans have idolised Rory Gilmore through her mindset and approach to education. This has illustrated how the findings contributed to examining how these perspectives have been shaped. The findings of the research supported existing perspectives. The concepts of active engagement of fans, which links to participatory culture and textual poaching were also reflected in the findings. Moreover, the main finding of the research, which demonstrated how fan videos have generated different approaches and feelings towards meaning through how they are produced. These findings also show links to theorists including Coppa, Bacon-Smith and Jenkins. Overall, the research has explored how fans have shaped aspirational perspectives on education through study motivation videos of Gilmore Girls. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Influencers on TikTok can boost businesses and influence consumer purchasing behavior. However, the type of user-generated material promoting communication between consumers and companies is less understood. This thesis aimed to explore role of Instagram and TikTok Influencers in shaping trust and engagement among Generation Z. Specifically, the study seeks to understand how influencers contribute to the formation of digital identity among Generation Z consumers. This study adopts a case study research design and employs a qualitative content analysis approach to investigate how influencers from Instagram and TikTok shape digital identity and build trust among Generation Z. The study population is Instagram and TikTok influencers who, together, are best known for talking to Generation Z about topics of self-expression, body positivity, mental health, and culture. Data was collected from influencers like Lydia Fowler&ensp;Mua and Nia the Light on Instagram, as well as Glamzilla and Jen on TikTok on the content written to personal narratives and experiences. The content analysis of the selected Instagram and TikTok influencers posted between November 2024 to April 2025, will target subclasses of trust-building and the shaping of the digital identity of Gen Z, thus performing a systematic analysis to collect these data. The content of the Instagram and the TikTok influencers that were analyzed demonstrates the prominent part they play in context with Generation Z&rsquo;s digital identity, trust, and engagement. Self-expression expressed through individuality, beauty inclusivity, and cultural identity, becomes a major focus for influencers. Influencers create a sense of belonging and validation among their followers through authentic interaction. Another component of it is trust, when influencers discuss their issues, and when they have these deeper conversations, they establish trust with their audiences. What it indicates is these are conversations that Generation Z is engaging in examining self-acceptance, mental wellness, and representation within culture as a whole and influencers are firmly established as the crafters of societal conversation in the digital age. Moreover, one of the prominent reasons for greatly impacting consumers' purchasing decisions is the trustworthiness of influencers, especially when it comes to product recommendations. The findings imply that transparency and authenticity come first in trust maintenance, where honest reviews and real interactions from the influencer to his audience must be based. This study offers several meaningful implications to influencers, brands, and social media platforms to improve trust-building and engagement specifically for Gen Z through the results. Instead, influencers need to create content that builds deep, meaningful connections with their audiences. They can do this by posting their own stories, being advocates for mental health, and sharing the causes they care about with their followers. Engaging the audience with interactive content like question-and-answer sessions and community challenges can strengthen engagement and establish credibility even more. Future research should seek to understand the long-term impact of influencer engagement on the psychological outcomes of Generation Z. This study addresses immediate interactions;&ensp;however, more research is warranted to explore how prolonged engagement with influencer content impacts self-perception and mental health outcomes longitudinally. Moreover, future studies may examine the impact of different social media algorithms on the visibility of influencers who discuss self-expression, body positivity, and cultural identity. Thus, understanding how content is ranked may reveal the structural reasons leading to digital engagement patterns.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.0 Introduction <br />1.1 Background Information <br />Nevertheless, within the recent years, an app which offers a much simpler way for the users to upload and view content has become incredibly popular among anyone of those age groups around the world. Regarding the platform, it&rsquo;s none other than world&rsquo;s largest global user base platform known as TikTok. In particular, as speed in content posting and extent that it put itself for public use have made it both a simple to use and quickly spread platform for the internet (Barry, 2024). Uploading its edited short videos is as easy as pie, thanks to its alluringly simple use interface, and it makes a brave challenge for Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are (Wright &amp; Cherry, 2023). Although TikTok is a global platform, it possesses high frequency interactions among its users and is now one of the best platforms to market (Lestari &amp; Tsabita, 2024). Moreover, statistics provide evidence that the brands in the collaboration have the best sales growth among the brands that partnerv with platforms other than tiktok (Maghraoui &amp; Khrouf, 2024).<br />According to Haenlein et al. (2020), TikTok is the most used social media platform by teenage and young adult demographic and young adult demographic finds it preferable. As a testament, TikTok&rsquo;s user base is significantly younger than Facebook&rsquo;s and Twitter&rsquo;s which are in their 40s, and about 25 year olds on Instagram. This choice of media use and difference in age group makes this difference worthy to notice (Yu &amp; Zheng, 2022). As TikTok trend is growing, featuring unique format and content, as well as the ability to give direct reach to younger audience, marketers may leverage from its use as an influencer marketing channel (Ligaraba et al., 2024). This is a good reason why we should analyze the influence of TikTok on young consumers if the platform as well as influencer marketing are growing to evolve. <br />According to Haenlein et al. (2020), product positioning and the variety of unique content were significant reasons in TikTok's appeal. They did not, however, investigate the type of user-generated material that promotes communication between consumers and businesses. The justification for participating in TikTok hashtag challenges has been captured by Nakayama et al. (2023). Given Gen Z's preference for authenticity, TikTok might be a helpful tool for promoting sponsored content, expanding fan interactions, and reaching new audiences (Erwin et al., 2023). According to Felix et al. (2024), TikTok also offers more participatory features than Instagram, enabling users to work together on and share films. Because of its unfiltered and unlawful content, this interactive element may have more negative than positive consequences on children, even though it allows users to demonstrate their abilities and capabilities (Rivai et al., 2023). Additionally, Putri et al. (2024) investigated how users self-represent their sexuality and body image on TikTok. While there have been several studies on TikTok's social and psychological effects on users, no research has been conducted on how their shopping patterns have changed.<br />Although social media and its influencers have been studied for their impacts on mental health and physical appearance, less is known about its impact on financial well-being. Previous study (e.g., Rivai et al., 2023), including trying to understand how fitspiration material on TikTok affects motivational and depressive symptoms and social comparisons continues to show that some forms of influencer content might actually increase symptoms of depression and generate negative social comparisons. Other studies have studied the potential effect of social comparison with regard to numerous emotional and psychological outcomes. For instance, social comparisons can make us feel better, but also put people at risk of depression, eating disorder and jealousy (Listiawati et al., 2024). For instance, in accordance with Lestari and Tsabita (2024), influencers often apply filters to present a chosen and idealised version of themselves, which would make followers tend to have social comparison through their looks. Comparisons between persons and ideal influencer personalities can be performed and lead to emotional pain and self-discrepant (Felix et al., 2024). Through this thesis, this gap is sought to bridge and to give new perspective on how consumers perceive and spend due to online interactions through the influence of financial well and being of TikTok influencers.<br />Despite influencer marketing quickly and universally being adopted by many digital marketers as a form of digital marketing, many questions are still unanswered about the various repercussions that influencer marketing might bring on consumers&rsquo; behaviours, for instance on rising platforms like TikTok. The literature has shown a significant influence of influencer marketing on brand engagement, trust and purchase intention on the platforms of YouTube and Instagram (Wang, 2024). Influencer consumer interaction research on TikTok has not advanced because of the unique conditions of TikTok including algorithm driven content discovery, short form video format, and high presence of trends, which are specific to the influencer consumer interaction environment of TikTok (Ghaleb &amp; Alawad, 2024).<br />Though the consumer behaviour of TikTok is not well explored yet, its rise and enormous demand from Gen Z and Millenials has made it a critical influencer marketing platform (Celestin &amp; Sujatha, 2024). For instance, fast and easy creation of trends by TikTok influencers, as well as holding audiences by engaging them with interactive features like challenges or duets, doesn't necessarily follow through to behavioural outcomes like brand loyalty or choice to purchase. Furthermore, little scholarly attention has been paid to the role of Social Influence Theory in understanding how TikTok users respond to influencers, whether through informational confidence in experts or normative expectations to conform (Celestin &amp; Sujatha, 2024). <br />This information gap is especially relevant because of the platform's ability to foster rapid virality, which may amplify both positive and negative consumer reactions. There is an urgent need for empirical research to identify how TikTok influencer marketing affects customer behaviour and the psychological mechanisms underlying these effects, especially as corporations invest increasing amounts of money to these initiatives. In addition to contributing to the scholarly discourse, bridging this gap will provide practitioners with valuable information for optimising their TikTok marketing strategies. According to various studies and TikTok use, the trust relationship between the platform and its users is significant (Barry, 2024), and advertisers must understand the kind of trip videos people find most engaging (Wright &amp; Cherry, 2023). Because young people, such as Gen Z, make up the bulk of TikTok users, it is interesting to explore how they perceive the app from several cultural perspectives.<br />In this study, the authors seek to explore the social construction of identity of Generation Z online and how Instagram and TikTok influencers have an influence on the digital identity of Generation Z based on the mechanisms of trust and engagement. But, according to Erwin et al. (2023), instead of just &lsquo;liking&rsquo; influencers Followers develop very deep emotional, as well as cognitive, connections with influencers. Despite the focus on the commercial aspects of influencer marketing by the previous researches, this study has a full coverage of the cultural and psychological components of the identity building (Ghalib &amp; Ardiansyah, 2023). In this study, the broader process of developing a digital identity via social media would be investigated through analyzing the interactions and content amongst three to five influencers.<br /> <br />2. Literature Review<br />2.1 Influencers and Digital Identity Formation<br />Ezzat (2020) defines identity as &ldquo;a person's internalised and evolving life story, integrating both reconstructed past and imagined future to provide life with some degree and purpose&rdquo; (p.5). Parents, friends, and role models all contribute to the formation of an individual's identity. Psychologists define identity as the aligning of one&rsquo;s capacities and proclivities with social roles as &lsquo;finding oneself&rsquo; (Mrad et al., 2022). Combining social media, sensors, themselves and digital identities, these are integrated into the computer coded systems (Van Eldik et al. 2019). Users enhance their digital footprints with their narratives, their photos, and their life experiences to attempt to lend their footprints more authentication. The attitudes of an individual's self-presentation including social participation, norms and self-efficacy affect the building of trust and loyalty towards the audience via the use of the digital identity of the person by the management of the perception of it (Bouncken &amp; Barwinski, 2021). To understand the process of how people, create their digital identity, it is important to research as to which components go into making a person's character online. According to Zwitter et al. (2020), there were some demographics, psychological states, physical attractiveness and personality traits that can influence the creation of online persona. Miyake (2023) also reported that there is a significant correlation between personality trait of extroversion and online self-disclosure after the pandemic.<br />There is nothing surprising about social media as users of it choose how they want to be viewed by other users. In an idealised picture of themselves, people disseminate self-promoting materials continuously as well as tailor the contents to the audience they care and present their real self to their close friends, as stated in Pradhan et al. (2023). Furthermore, content creators frequently associate with companies that share their beliefs, which influences how they respond to ads or products. Li (2022) asserts that social media provides nearly limitless opportunities for strategic self-presentation and that users are more likely to display their genuine selves in less anonymous and more visible situations. Furthermore, Silva et al. (2020) found that people with a strong sense of self prefer to portray both their actual and ideal selves, while emerging adults with identity conflict often present a more idealised, sometimes manufactured version of themselves to gain social acceptance.<br />By allowing users to adopt many identities or personas in virtual settings, online identities facilitate persona adoption (Crisafulli and Singh, 2022). At the same time, Lim and Lee (2023) suggest substituting the term &ldquo;real world&rdquo; with &ldquo;non-virtual,&rdquo; arguing that user-generated and maintained virtual identities might be equally valid as their offline equivalents. the traditional distinction between online and physical environments, emphasising the significance and reality of digital identities. This point of view emphasises the challenges of establishing an identity in modern digital environments by stressing the complex interrelationship between online and offline identities.<br />2.2 Engagement as a Driver of Digital Identity<br />Information and communication technology (ICT), social media, and the Internet all offer constant access to human interaction and information. A new way of living, working, communication, and learning have appeared as a consequence of the digital technology mediated social interaction (Masiero and Bailur, 2021). Organisational behaviour, psychology, and sociology are the foundations of the concept of engagement (Munaro et al., 2021). From a community perspective, engagement includes a customer's innate desire to interact and work together with others (Oliveira &amp; Fernandes, 2022). Other definitions of involvement include the client's conduct that goes beyond their purchase habit (Hollebeek &amp; Macky, 2019). In other words, client involvement stems from motivating drivers. The development of the digital literacy that future labour markets would need, for instance, is facilitated by online interactions, knowledge sharing, and learning computer programs to produce, design, or program artefacts (Ezzat, 2020).<br />However, youth engagement and activities on the digital sphere are not fixed, and range in size and shape. For example, in the case of the friendships that drove (preserving peer ties) and the interest-driven motivations (learning about a certain topic) of online engagement, Hamzah et al. (2021). Social Networking, Entertainment, and Gaming &ndash; this is friendship driven activity; the other is creative, artistic, and goal-oriented media use (information search, creation and sharing of text, movies, websites including important ICT skills). From more of their Western countries numerous polls indicate that most youths who participate in these activities are mostly friendship driven (Nyadzayo et al., 2020).<br />Research indicates that contact is crucial for creating one's digital identity in a variety of ways. People construct their digital persons through deliberate on-line behaviour. Merunkov&aacute; and &Scaron;lerka (2019) basis its self-presentation theory on the fact that people manage how they are perceived in social context arranged from the online world as a case in point. Everyone sees the opportunity to essentially assemble our digital identities in a way that selectively shares our best selfies, our credentials, our stories, and as a result, studies have found that people do construct those digital identities (Ntshangase et al. 2023). One&rsquo;s digital identity is being engaged and one&rsquo;s online character is being shaped through interactions with peers. Some aspects of a user&rsquo;s digital identity receive social validation (likes, comments, etc.), as well as reinforcement (Glavee-Geo et al., 2020). A higher involvement of audiences influences the online reputation the more participation there is, as Fernandes and Castro (2020) have discovered.<br />In a sense in some online cultures, users can openly participate into digital communities to negotiate their digital identities. As part of Wenger&rsquo;s (1998) notion of communities of practice, online forums and organisations could enable participation to strengthen identities within the digital ecosystems. Research on social media activism shows that people use engagement to articulate a concordance among their online persona with causes and movements (Ezzat, 2020). Engagement enhances the digital identity but also increases the risk of authenticity and privacy risk. As found by Mrad et al. (2022), the cause of such discrepancy is the necessity to uphold a digital identity that is perceived to be idealised. Additionally, there is a tendency for exchange to lead to data security and digital footprint issues (Bouncken &amp; Barwinski, 2021).<br />2.3 The Role of Cultural Narratives in Digital Identity Formation<br />Therefore, cultural narratives are important because they affect how people approach digital environments, present themselves online, and perceive their online identities (Granic et al., 2020). The process of developing a digital identity is a process of continuous formation of the combination of your personal, cultural and social components. Cultural narratives are the basic scripts to people&rsquo;s self expression. Persons use shared cultural symbols, traditions, and collective history to build and maintain their online identities (Bates and colleagues, 2020). For example, people build their identities in ways that either reaffirm, resist or reinterpret prevailing cultural stories, and social media platforms such as Twitter are digital platforms for storytelling (Bradford &amp; Syed, 2019).<br />Additionally, cultural narratives influence the digital identity from the social validation and identification community perspective (Mihelj &amp; Jim&eacute;nez-Mart&iacute;nez, 2021). Users, in the practice of validation, often refer to online communities with similar cultural background, creating digital kinfolk and also constructing ascendancy, (Essamri et al., 2019). In addition to, the affordances of the digital platform facilitate the amplification of cultural narratives, therefore marginalized voices can rewrite historical narratives and build new identities (Cerezo et. Al., 2020). Thus, while the advantages abound in the digital world cultural narratives can be misinterpreted, commercialized or tampered with to remove authenticity and self-expression (Bradford &amp; Syed, 2019). <br />The increasing digital spaces also create questions about the relationship between identity formation and cultural narrative that concern agency, representation and the inclusion in digital (Feher, 2021). The usage of artificial intelligence, algorithmic curation and laws relating to platforms may be in favour of particular narratives and thus present difficulties in how cultural narratives impact the formation of digital identities (Nyadzayo et al., 2020). However, it is therefore important to understand the part that these cultural narratives play in the generation of digital identities in order to cultivate more diverse and inclusive online environments that support genuine means of self-expression and of expressing culture (Cerezo et al., 2020). Digital media is a powerful and revolutionary force that has become a new and revolutionary medium that is transforming communication, culture and society in modern world (J&uacute;nior et al. 2023). Technology helps to establish digital media ability to link and communicate in real time beyond geographical borders. Not only a communication tool, but digital media is also a powerful tool for accentuating cultural identity, one of the important aspects of contemporary society defined in relation with digital media.<br />However, Robiady et al. (2021) assert that identity is not a &lsquo;thing&rsquo; in itself but rather an idea built from social interaction and social connotations. The online identities show us how people change their identity and social relations through digital means, since they are freely formed. In simpler words, there are less effects of an individual's internal psychological state on how an individual creates and preserves an identity to the social and technological exterior environment. <br />2.4 Influencers and Trust Building <br />The business employs influencer marketing, a digital communication strategy that leverages well-known internet personalities to promote items (Scott, 2018). The literature suggests that when assessing individuals who are branded or well-known, the concept of brand trust needs to be considered. The role of brand trust as a mediator between purchase intention and influencer endorsement was examined (Wang &amp; Chan-Olmsted, 2024). The research study conducted by Kim and Kim (2021) examined &ldquo;how social media influencers affect consumers' perceptions of brands, their faith in those brands, and the amount of money spent on sponsored content&rdquo; (p. 23). The reactions of social media users to influence marketing campaigns are investigated in this study. The results provide information about how the traits of social media influencers affect how customers see sponsored companies and the material they post. Digital influencers facilitate communication between businesses and customers, fostering a closer bond and enabling more organic brand and consumer interactions that impact consumer purchasing decisions (Shamim &amp; Islam, 2022).<br />It is expected that customers will have positive attitudes towards a company as well as feel the brand cares about them on the basis of customers&rsquo; trust of social media influencers (Hemming, 2020). Considering the signalling theory viewpoint (Singh et al., 2020), customers tend to have a higher disposition towards a product supplied by a recommender if the latter does not provide much information about it and, moreover, if he has a high confidence. As explained by Shamim and Islam (1222), trustworthy recommender, who is referred to as influencers, rely on informational cues to present themselves trustful and distinct from other items they suggest. They therefore influence the consumers&rsquo; attitude and behavior regarding the suggested products (Pop et al., 2022). The social learning theory also provides a further explanation to this relationship because people often watch to then imitate the successful behaviours of notable individuals (Shamim &amp; Islam, 2022). Therefore, because at a base level a social media influencer is recommending a brand to their followers, those followers may also favourably act toward and like the company. <br />According to Shamim and Islam (2022), &ldquo;more favourable motives are assigned to liked people,&rdquo; which is why likes, a good emotional link, boost consumers' perception of trust (p.5). The literature claims that likability is composed of several qualities that are connected to trust, including honesty, thoughtfulness, and care (Sharma &amp; Khandeparkar, 2025). The prediction method is used by As explained by Leung et al. (2022) to explain the substantial relationship that they found between like and trust. If individuals like their predictions about someone&rsquo;s future conduct, they will expect that it predicts the behavior (Rachmad &amp; MM, 2024). According to the context of the study, loving a brand means that consumers trust the brand&rsquo;s owners to take care of them and offer them those products and services that are best suited to meet their demands.<br />2.5 Theoretical Framework<br />2.5.1 Digital Identity<br />Identity theory holds that social interactions are always ingrained in society and are used by people to create their identities; as a result, society forms the self, which in turn determines behaviour (Li &amp; Ren, 2024). Originally emphasizing role identities, identity theory has lately broadened its scope to encompass social or group identities as well as individual identities (Molotokienė, 2020). A person's social roles in society, such as that of a friend, mother, employee, or student, are known as their role identities. According to Davis et al. (2019), identity theory predicts the outcome of identity verification procedures, explains the identity verification process, and predicts the composition of the self. Marsman (2024) defines social identities as those that, via sharing characteristics, signify membership in a larger category or group. The qualities that enable a person to identify as a unique individual are known as personal identities. These characteristics include being kind, stubborn, moral, greedy, and so on. In contrast to social or role identities, person identities are regarded as &ldquo;master identities,&rdquo; operating both within and outside of the social/group and role identities that people claim, as well as the environments in which these identities are ingrained (Sedlmeir et al., 2021). <br />While identity theory is useful for understanding the effects of digital mediation, the conditions of digital mediation also impact modern forms of identity theory (Li &amp; Ren, 2024). They explicitly ask about the meaning of simultaneously spanning several networks and settings. Each phase of the current study ended with theoretical issues supported by empirical data about the function of social media in situational structures, identity verification procedures, identity verification outcomes, multiple identity enactment, and identity change.<br />Digital Identity Theory, which describes how people use interactions, self-representation, and social endorsement to create and present their identities to others in online spaces, makes use of this type of interaction and is crucial to the current study. Within Instagram and TikTok, Generation Z users engage with influencers out of pursuit in the digital identity formation process, looking for relatable individuals who endorse similar values, future-oriented aspirations, and personal stories (Davis et al., 2019). In turn, influencers shape their digital personas through the strategic sharing of content that aligns with cultural topics like self-expression, body positivity, and mental health and influences how their audiences view and create their digital selves. Using content analysis, this research aims to trace the role of influencers in the continuous identity negotiation process in digital settings, highlighting that trust in influencers is usually ascribed to their skill to sincerely portray what resonates with the subjective experiences of their followers (Majeed et al., 2020).<br />Moreover, Digital Identity Theory also highlights the significance of audience engagement, feedback, and platform affordances in shaping the construction of online identities as a dynamic and interactive process (Cover, 2023). When influencers post in regard to certain subject matter, their audience engages with the content via likes comments and shares to reinforce an idea and a set of identity norms and values. Specifically, this study will interrogate this engagement as a collaborative effort partaking in a participatory logic of digital trust-building through the co-creation of a shared identity between the influencer and their followers. Furthermore, the research will also explore how the construction of digital identity is formed through not only direct self-representation but also the social validation frameworks within the Instagram and TikTok platforms by examining their linguistic and visual content. Utilizing Digital Identity Theory, this study will further explore the implications of influencers and Generation Z on identity narratives and trust in the digital landscape.<br />2.5.2 Social Media Influencers <br />Digital content creators are a group of people who create digital content and are able to get the line that people like their content a lot, engage with it and share it with others across social media (Duffy, 2020). Such marketing communication is information, direction and inspiration to make money with the branded goods and services to their fan bases (Ooi et al., 2023). In the case of the influencers' brand endorsements, the persuasion communication tends to be treated as being more 'authentic' or 'organic' than traditional paid advertising because the influencers' endorsement is already included into what they have in their already existing repertoire of narrative, textual or / and visual content (G&oacute;mez, 2019). Therefore, the increase in influencer marketing has been rapid in recent times.<br />The sheer number of influencers has increased, although its veterans and their community remain diverse within and across platforms and industries: true influencers argue against the use of the term &ldquo;influencer&rdquo; as tools to the extent their influence on consumer decisions is fairly dubious (Powell &amp; Pring, 2024). Additionally, on most occasions, the major influencers create a brand around a certain social media platform like Weibo, Instagram, YouTube, and Twitch, despite the fact that they are meant to be marketing their brand disregard the rest of the social media environment. Recently, Instagram has become the new baby of influencer marketing, and in 2018, businesses are expected to spend more than USD 1 billion on Instagram influencers (Ouvrein et al, 2021).<br />In addition, this study depends on the Social Media Influencers Theory as it explains how these influencers will influence the audience perception, behavior and trust with the aid of the presence of these influencers on the social media and the way they engage with their audience. Today, it is stated that driving theory helps to understand the fact that influencers are opinion leaders who carry their credibility,&ensp;relatability, and expertise to influence how the audience is building his attitudes to and the choice he makes (Duffy, 2020). As authentic sources of information, Gen Z looks up to influencers who share Instagram images and TikTok videos about self-expression, body positivity, mental health, cultural information, and so on. It is what they are capable of building through personal and emotional content that makes them key to the making of our digital identities. This study will explore how the influencers strategically present themselves and use engagement tactics in order to influence the Generation Z perceptions of identity, values and social norms while supporting the view that digital trust with constant interaction and authenticity (Hudders et al., 2021).<br />More than that, Social Media Influencers Theory signifies a specific engagement between influencers and Generation Z on one hand, and mutual set of trust and credibility in co-construction with audience on the other. Influencers are not a lay person who just post content but rather also strive to engage their followers as active participants through direct interaction, comments, and interactive stickers such as surveys and Q&amp;A, further establishing a sense of community, and involving their followers (Powell &amp; Pring, 2024). These engagements fostered a mutually beneficial relationship, whereby followers align themselves to influencers who they find relatable and reliable individuals, resulting in greater trust and personalization regarding what the influencer is advocating. Hence, this study seeks to close this gap by analyzing the very same linguistic and visual strategies that influencers employ to actually create a feel of authenticity, maintenance of audience and the formation of digital personalities utilizing earned theory. Consequently, that view will help to deepen the knowledge of the role of those social media influencers at play in the trust and engagement behavior of Generation Z towards tellers within the metaverse.<br />2.5.3 Uses and Gratifications Theory<br />As Falgoust et al. (2022) explains, UGT theory states that people look for different media to meet their needs and desires. According to UGT (Ray et al., 2019), it is a satisfied media consumers&rsquo; choice to meet a variety of social, recreational and informative needs. Customers use the Internet for five reasons that are entertainment, convenience, time passing, interpersonal value, information searching, as stated by Haridakis and Humphries (2019). Each one of these elements plays a role to how much happy people are. Kasirye (2024) claims that these needs and incentives affect people&rsquo;s selection of suitable media based on gratification or expected benefits of media intake. The human uniqueness in terms of personality attributes and experiences in different contexts impact people&rsquo;s needs and motivation (Kamboj, 2020).<br />To attain the highest levels of satisfaction for their needs and desires, UGT asserts that users actively understand and incorporate media messages and advertisements into their daily activities, and they select their channels with a specific goal in mind (Boudkouss &amp; Djelassi, 2021). Users search for many channels to entertain themselves, to get their education, to interact, to live, to escape, to be social or otherwise, as UGT underscores. The self-regulation, media self-efficacy, attitude and habit towards channel choice are the elements which differentiate the users of channel (Hossain et al., 2019).<br />Moreover, UGT states that users actually have an understanding of the messages and commercials of media and commercials and of the channels they use and choose them for the purpose to achieve the highest levels of their wants and desires dispositions (Boudkouss &amp; Djelassi, 2021). The users of the platforms actively seek on different channels to get their needs fulfilled, be social, be escapist, educational or entertainment. Some of the factors that determine users&rsquo; channels selection are past views, self-efficacy, media self-efficacy, and habitual behavior (Hossain et al., 2019).<br />The Uses and Gratification theory is an optimistic theory of digital media in which people choose a media alternative only to accomplish a goal. They may also end up following the media&rsquo;s impact in terms of &lsquo;the way the world thinks&rsquo; about their cultural identities (Xu et al., 2025). Nowadays there are many different kinds of digital media tools that have the capacity to influence customers in particular way (Kocak et al., 2020). Like a pickaxe, these media tools have a huge potential as cultural representation for life in different areas and are effective in influencing individuals over time (Zafar et al., 2020).<br />According to the theory, media consumers look for a digital media source that accommodates their needs (as satisfaction, cultural expression, education, enjoyment, belongingness and identity); (Shi et al., 2024). We can say that the idea is a user has other options to answer the needs. These demands are for the need for identity politics, diversion, personal connections, and surveillance (Uddin, et al, 2021). The Digital media use takes a humanistic nod in its application of the hypothesis of the uses and gratifications (Zafar et al., 2020). This implies that consumers are active users of digital media content through authentic consumption of the content to meet their needs.<br />This is an important theory because the Uses and Gratification Theory (UGT) describes the notion where people have certain psychological as well as social needs and in that case would seek for certain particular media content. Specifically, with regard to Instagram and TikTok, Generation Z are consuming influencer content to meet these several underlying needs, entertainment, identity, social, and information (Falgoust et al., 2022). When generation Z consumers choose to consume and share content created by influencers based on elements of the self-expression, body positivity, mental health, and subculture, they highlight their identity and values. Finally, UGT discusses the purpose of consumers looking for relatable content and validation, a principle that can be explored to determine why Gen Z believes in these influencer and the reason they fill the consumers&rsquo; needs for relatable content and validation whilst also building a community online. With regard to the influencer posts, this study can use UGT as a theoretical lens to propose how digital identity formation is a user&ndash;observed process in which the users themselves actively consume the posted content that meet their own personal and social motivations.<br />Moreover, UGT helps explaining the degree of commitment of Gen Z, to interact with and react to influencer content. This theory of gratifications refers to these kinds of the excitement or inspiration, emotional support and belonging that are forms of product to this theory and this theory is aimed against the idea that audiences are passive consumer (Kujur and Singh, 2020). This helps providing influencers to build trust and credibility by creating content relying on what their followers are into, resulting with greater engagement via likes, shares, and comments (Kamboj, 2020). It also highlights the active role of social media user in creating meaning through discussions and the social activities the user does as hurdles while they try and get into direct interaction or use content that holds the same meaning with as much people with similar interest as one could imagine. Such mirror imaging of the purpose of the study is to investigate how cultural themes that are provided by agents such as influencers accommodate trust building and engendering among the Gen Z witnessing the flip side of digital identity that is made rather than forced.</p>\n<p>3.0 Research Questions, Aims and Objectives <br />3.1 Research Aim <br />The main objective of this study is to determine the role of Instagram and TikTok Influencers in shaping trust and engagement among Generation Z. Specifically, the study seeks to understand how influencers contribute to the formation of digital identity among Generation Z consumers.<br />3.2 Research Questions (RQ)<br />&bull; How do Instagram and TikTok influencers foster trust and shape digital identity among Generation Z through their content?<br />&bull; What are the patterns of engagement exhibited by Generation Z in response to cultural themes presented by social media influencers?<br />3.3 Research Objectives (RO)<br />&bull; To identify the trust-building mechanisms employed by influencers and analyse how these strategies contribute to shaping the digital identities of their followers. <br />&bull; To understand how influencers contribute the formation of the digital identity among gen z contribution.</p>\n<p>4.0 Research Methodology<br />4.1 Research Design <br />Research design of the study is the case study research design, and the methodology is the qualitative content analysis, both adopted in an attempt of providing insights through in-depth exploration (Asenahabi, 2019), and to systematize the analysis of patterns, themes, and narratives of such content to understand the strategies influencers use to build trust. Content analysis allows us to detect the way of presentation, the authenticity and the pattern of interaction the influencer uses as well as with which features a digital identity is developed (Muzari et al., 2022). The analytical method in study is made use of to achieve The aim of a Qualitative content analysis as applied by Alam (2021), which refers to phenomena of post, caption of the post, comments of the post, and visual aspects of the post for the resolving insight of how links between posts of influencers and the reaction to their audiences connected with the matter of building trust between generation Z via producing the culture and modes of interactions in digital.<br />Within a digital identity, this methodology becomes an empirical methodology that provides an understanding of how influencers&rsquo; content is curated across the digital network in order to capitalize on the Generation Z values, interests, and expectations. A key finding was that examples of techniques that build trust, both implicitly and explicitly, such as storytelling, transparency, and engaging with listeners add credibility to the influencer (Lindgren et al., 2020). Furthermore, the examination of audience behavioral patterns (i.e., the sentiment of comments left under the content, the frequency of engagement, and whether the thematic absence/presence was found in the influencer's posts) enables the study to take the most significant aspect of trust and co-creation in cyberspace into consideration - that is, audience engagement (Moran et al., 2020). The data collection strategy provides an overview of this developing influencer&ndash;audience interplay and its consequence on the digital identity-shaping process. <br />4.2 Population and Sampling <br />Instagram and TikTok influencers are the study population and the ones known for talking to Generation Z about topics of self-expression, body positivity, mental health, and culture. Because the study focuses on digital identity and building of trust, the technique used will be purposive sampling of the influencers whose content showcases consistency with Generation Z audience. Such non-probability sampling helps analyze only those influencers that will be assisting in reforming the digital identity through their content (Thomas, 2022). The proposed study will uncover the processes involved in how influencers shape Generation Z's perceptions and engagement behaviors by featuring influencers whose content is positively aligned culturally and trust oriented.<br />To be able to focus the analysis on the most recent activity, a sample of the last 10 to 15 posts from each identified influencer will be analyzed. This sampling strategy is justified for content analysis since the characteristics of trending content ensure that this sampling will reflect current online interaction trends (Sibona et al, 2020). This textual analysis will entail captions, hashtags, and how the audience is responding to the content to uncover what central cultural ideas and values are nested to enable the means used by influencers to establish trust through content, and what role such content plays in the continuity in the individuals' digital identity in the social media world (Hidayat &amp; Hidayat, 2020).<br />4.3 Data collection procedure <br />Data will be collected from influencers like Lydia Fowler&ensp;Mua and Nia the Light on Instagram, as well as Glamzilla and Jen on TikTok on the content written to personal narratives and experiences. Lydia Fowler Mua and Nia the Light on Instagram and Glamzilla and Jen on TikTok. These influencers were selected because of their strong Generation Z engagement in mind and their influence on things such as self-expression representation in terms of beauty standards, body positivity, and culture in the digital identity. Lydia Fowler Mua is makeup and skincare, based on building trust through authentic play and professional advice. In contrast, Nia the Light advance's themes of self-love and natural beauty, appealing to younger generations seeking representation and empowerment. On TikTok, Glamzilla is known for her frank discussions of beauty, mental health, and self-acceptance, making her an easy-to-relate-to figure for Gen Z users. Jen also uses her platform to educate about facial features and makeup techniques, helping followers navigate beauty standards while building a sense of community. This selection was based on this study&rsquo;s key focus area of how influencers build trust, engage with followers, and shape identity online.<br />The content analysis of the selected Instagram and TikTok influencers posted between November 2024 to April 2025, will target subclasses of trust-building and the shaping of the digital identity of Generation Z, thus performing a systematic analysis to collect these data. Initially, the posts are compiled based on a list that the researcher decides based on the textual components that we are focusing on, and it can be the captions, hashtags, comments, etc. These features significantly enhance the interaction between influencers and their audience. Metrics including likes, shares, and comments will also be monitored as indicators of audience engagement and response trends. The study aims to provide a systematic approach to exploring how influencers communicate authenticity and create trust through the posts they share (Vaismoradi &amp; Snelgrove, 2019). <br />4.4 Data Analysis<br />The analysis process will be qualitative content analysis to identify major themes, patterns, and narratives that emerge across content generated by influencers. Initially, the accumulated information (captions, hashtags, comments, engagement metrics) is structured and coded in accordance with previously set accreditations in the spelling of the synonym of the pillars of trust building, self-expression, body positivity, mental health and culture. This study will next employ a thematic analysis framework to uncover meaning of the underlying and how influencers build trust to those of Generation Z through the use of digital identities. In the content analysis process, we conducted we check and code systematically the 10&ndash;15 last posts of each selected influencer in Instagram and TikTok where the focus is given mainly to the textual, visual and interactive components of those different platforms. Key themes related to the self-expression, body positivity,&ensp;cultural representation, engagement strategies and trust building mechanism&ensp;will be identified by narrative analysis. Among others, this entails analyzing comments and interactions so as to determine how followers interact and respond to the contents of influencers&rsquo; posts in order to understand what makes digital identities and trust formation from the actor and the beneficiary&rsquo;s perspective. The guiding question will be to analyze linguistic and engagement strategies as well as how content resonates with audiences and contributes to the formation of trust (Vaismoradi &amp; Snelgrove, 2019). Plan for periodic review of the coding process (i.e., coding sample by a second coder for intercoder reliability). By taking this methodical approach, the study will scrutinize influencer-related content and its implications for Generation Z's online digital identity and engagement patterns.<br />4.5 Limitation<br />This research focuses on case study research design and employs a qualitative content analysis approach to investigate how influencers from Instagram and TikTok shape digital identity and build trust among Generation Z. However, this research has several limitations. The research data will be collected from influencers like Lydia Fowler&ensp;Mua and Nia the Light on Instagram, as well as Glamzilla and Jen on TikTok. The data limits only these influencers, which may not generalize to all of the influencers throughout TikTok and Instagram. Analysis is also limited to TikTok and Instagram, where there are also other platforms, for example, YouTube, X, etc., where Generation Z gets to engage with the influencers. The data of this research paper only covers from November 2024 to April 2025, which is a six-month window, this period may miss the trends, for example, holiday marketing. <br />5.0 Finding and Discussion <br />Theme 1: Identity Formation and Trust Building<br />Social media influencers are instrumental in self-expression and identity formation among Generation Z. From the data collected, influencers like Lydia Fowler&ensp;Mua and Nia The Light on Instagram or Glamzilla and Jen on TikTok address content written to personal narratives and experiences. Much of their content revolves around self-acceptance, beauty, and confidence, urging young followers to examine and ponder their identity. For instance, Nia The Light frequently speaks of celebrating natural hair, an issue that resonates with fans who may struggle with societal beauty standards. Likewise, Lydia Fowler is creating a virtual network for Generation Z,&ensp;one where they can feel truly themselves (often thanks to her constant posts about body positivity and her very own skin-care routine). This would seem to fit the notion of forming a digital identity, whereby people construct their selfhood and present themselves for consideration about these networks online (Li &amp; Ren, 2024). The interactivity afforded by social media supports this process of identity formation. The comments and conversations across these influencers reveal how they seek validation and guidance to help create their online persona. Jen&rsquo;s TikTok videos about facial structure and makeup techniques are guided by the idea that users need to know how beauty practices relate to their identity. Jen 's followers trust her with their skin, comments like 'thank you for helping me with my skin' show how she builds trust with her audience.<br /> <br />Figure 1: Screenshot of a TikTok comment section under Jen&rsquo;s video, showing follower trust in her skincare advice (Source: @l_yuhann, TikTok, 2025).<br />Glamzilla&rsquo;s openness about her struggles, from insecurities with her skin to mental health issues, helps create a sense of relatability and community among her followers. Not a conventional content creator but also a digital self-discovery and identity reinforcement facilitator, social media influencers uniquely fit the current spot.<br />Theme 2: Representation and Cultural Themes <br />Cultural representation is another prominent theme in the content analysis. Influencers relate these cultural narratives across many audiences using their platforms. Nia The Light, for instance, brings elements of her Zimbabwean and British identity to her content, so followers with similar backgrounds feel a sense of belonging. This also aligns with Uses and Gratification Theory where when audience or follower seek for content that aligns with their cultural and social values (Kamboj, 2020). Culturally, this story construction reinforces post-engagement as the extension of the influencer/follower relationship, adding meaning to the mere engagement. For instance, adding the words &lsquo;Zimbabwean &amp; British Gemini in London&rsquo; in Nia The Light&rsquo;s Instagram Bio quickly catch the eye of the audiences with similar background.<br /> <br />Figure 2: Screenshot of NiaTheLight&rsquo;s Instagram profile post (Source: @niathelight, Instagram, 2025).<br />The aspects of Asian beauty standards Glamzilla refers to in her content are clear in that they mirror aspects of those who are most hungry for representation in the beauty narrative. While influencers are not individuals, they are driving the narrative of what is socially acceptable and validating like-minded thoughts among their followers. Jen&rsquo;s face shape tutorials also subtly contest different standards of beauty, as they deconstruct preexisting ideals that place a premium on certain features and not others. Lydia Fowler&rsquo;s collaborations with various beauty brands also attempt to embrace inclusivity,&ensp;featuring products that cater to the needs and shades of a wide variety of skin tones and types. As can be seen in the comments on posts like these, the positive reception shows followers want content that reflects their own cultural/ethnic identities, which illustrates how representation matters even in social media spaces. <br />Theme 3: Community Building and Engagement <br />The patterns of influencer engagement also call attention to social media as a tool for building communities; both Instagram and TikTok influencers respond to comments, welcoming their followers into the discussion. This is especially evident in Jen&rsquo;s videos, during which followers ask for explanations of her makeup techniques, and she gives detailed answers and makes the consumption of content less of a one-directional trip and more of participation from their followers in the content creation lab. <br /> <br />Figure 3: Screenshot of Jen&rsquo;s TikTok profile post (Source: @l_yuhann, TikTok, 2025).<br />Also, liking, sharing, and commenting are all forms of user engagement, which are also a type of collective digital discourse. Glamzilla&rsquo;s candor about her feelings draws sympathy from her audience, and many people who message her in the comments say they lend their support. In a similar vein, Nia The Light&rsquo;s hair care discussions provoke conversation among followers who exchange tips and personal experiences. According to Social Media Influencer Theory, two-way interaction between the influencers and the followers builds emotional bonds and increases loyalty (Powell &amp; Pring, 2024). It makes retention rates better, and the trust of the collaborators is increased, as they become authority figures in these spaces of content creation. <br />Theme 4: Consumer behavior and Commercial Influence <br />The data also demonstrates how influences influence consumer decisions through product endorsements and brand partnerships. Lydia Fowler&rsquo;s makeup tutorials and product endorsements function as soft marketing that helps inform what her followers buy. She changes how the audience perceives beauty products by showing product usage in action and including her reviews. According to Social Media Influencer Theory, such endorsements carry persuasive power because influencers are perceived as authentic and relatable (Ooi et al., 2023). <br /> <br />Figure 4: Screenshot of Lydia&rsquo;s Instagram profile post (Source: @lydiafowler, Instagram, 2025).<br />Similarly, Glamzilla&rsquo;s promotion of certain skincare and lifestyle products flows through her authenticity, making her recommendations feel more company than promotional. However, fans evaluate these endorsements critically, and even some comments are questioning product effectiveness. <br /> <br />Figure 5: Screenshot of a TikTok comment section under Glamzilla&rsquo;s video, showing follower questioning product effectiveness (Source: @glamzilla, TikTok, 2025).<br />This means that while influencers have great persuasive authority,&ensp;audiences are still discerning. Instead, Jen&rsquo;s in-depth breakdowns of makeup techniques fit an educational marketing approach, where a follower sees value in content beyond a loudspeaker for a brand. Overall, these three components (trust,&ensp;authenticity, and expertise) make influencer marketing effective when it comes to shaping consumer behavior in digital identity domains.<br />Theme 5: Visibility and Algorithmic Influence <br />Social media algorithms significantly determine how much influencers&rsquo; content is seen, as they prioritize engagement metrics such as likes, comments, and shares. This means influencers need to shape their content strategies accordingly to stay relevant. For instance, Jen&rsquo;s tutorial videos answer specific questions, increasing engagement through interactions.<br /> <br />Figure 6: Screenshot of a TikTok comment section under Jen&rsquo;s video, showing Jen interactions with her followers (Source: @l_yuhann, TikTok, 2025). <br />This strategy means that her content stays relevant within algorithm-driven platforms. But it is also algorithmic biases that are impacting which influencers rise to fame, reflecting Digital Identity Theory in the context of platform affordances (Majeed et al., 2020). Content reach is influenced by factors such as location, type of content, and the demographics of the audience which can affect exposure for some of the creators. Insights into these dynamics allow influencers and marketers to optimize content for maximum effective impact. <br />Theme 6: Wellbeing and Mental Health <br />There has been a rising concern about the influence that the content of influences has on mental health. Although interaction with influencers can have positive effects on self-esteem and a sense of community, excessive environmental exposure to beauty can lead to negative outcomes due to unrealistic portrayals of beauty. Glamzilla's candid discussion of body insecurities is an important step toward rectifying that kind of thing and normalizing vulnerability. To mitigate these effects, influencers need to balance between aspirational and realistic content. This reflects the Uses and Gratifications Theory again, where users turn to influencers not only for entertainment but for emotional support and identity validation (Sedlmeir et al., 2021). Overall, encouraging the visualization of transparency, actively promoting self-care, and advocating for mental health awareness will help build better digital environments for Generation Z audiences. <br />6.0 Conclusion and recommendations <br />6.1 Conclusion <br />The content of the Instagram and the TikTok influencers that analyzed demonstrates the prominent part they play in context with Generation Z&rsquo;s digital identity, trust, and engagement. Self-expression expressed through individuality, beauty inclusivity, and cultural identity, becomes a major focus for influencers. Influencers create a sense of belonging and validation among their followers through authentic interaction. <br />Another component of it is trust, when influencers discuss their issues, and when they have these deeper conversations, they establish trust with their audiences. What it indicates is these are conversations that Generation Z is engaging in examining self-acceptance, mental wellness, and representation within culture as a whole and influencers are firmly established as the crafters of societal conversation in the digital age.<br />Moreover, one of the prominent reasons for greatly impacting consumers' purchasing decisions is the trustworthiness of influencers, especially when it comes to product recommendations. The findings imply that transparency and authenticity come first in trust maintenance, where honest reviews and real interactions from the influencer to his audience must be based.<br />In summary, this research highlights the meaningful shift away from passive consumption to engagement and co-creation in the influencer-followership landscape. With Generation Z's growing engagement, as well as the continued evolution of digital identity, influencers will serve as an important mechanism for establishing trust and a sense of identity.</p>\n<p>6.2 Practical Implications<br />This study offers several meaningful implications to influencers, brands, and social media platforms to improve trust-building and engagement specifically for Gen Z through the results. Instead, influencers need to create content that builds deep, meaningful connections with their audiences. They can do this by posting their own stories, being advocates for mental health, and sharing the causes they care about with their followers. Engaging the audience with interactive content like question-and-answer sessions and community challenges can strengthen engagement and establish credibility even more.<br />Secondly, brands should be more committed&ensp;to a long-term relationship than a single promotion when partnering with influencers. Campaigns should have consistent narratives across campaigns to create more realistic content, something that otherwise does not feel so saturated and commercial. Although brands need to provide influencers with room to give products and messaging straight narration, audiences will accept the brands as genuine only if both of them believe in the influencers&rsquo; authenticity.<br />Third, social media platforms must also consider and adjust their recommendation algorithms to ensure that the piece that builds positive digital identities propagate. Instead of promoting post that has used as a means of self-expression, cultural inclusivity and mental health can result in a healthier online space. Implementing devices for content verification also enhances the esteem of the people because they will be taught in clarity about paid collaborations.<br />The fourth is that there should be proper educational organizations that should incorporate digital literacy programs on the curriculum of the students to help them develop skills to critically think and see whether the influencer content is useful or not. Help young people understand how to scrutinize credibility, how to watch for possible biases, as well as distinguish between a real recommendation and a paid promotion. Not only does it give young people the power to have educated dealings online, but it also requires more from an influencer.<br />Lastly, policymakers and advocacy groups should strive to create industry standards for responsible influencer marketing. Such guidelines around transparency, clear and responsible advertising, and the representation of mental health in digital content can help ensure that influencer culture continues to be a positive force in the construction of a digital identity. All vested parties have a role to play in ensuring that social media content is trustworthy and engaging, while also balancing commercial interests and the well-being of their audience.<br />6.3 Recommendations for future research<br />Future research should investigate the longer term consequences of influencing in terms of the psychological consequences on Generation Z. Regarding immediate interactions, this study responds, while further research is needed to determine how individual&rsquo;s engagement in influencer content can modify their self-perception and mental health over time.<br />Additionally, more studies may unpack the effects of differ social media algorithms on viewpoints regarding self-expression, body positivity and cultural identity by people who are influencers. Knowledge of the ranking of content may help explain why digital engagement occurs as a result of certain structural reasons.<br />A comparative study in other cultural environments could also shed light on that aspect of regional differences in influencer trustworthiness. Examining how Generation Z from different geographic areas engage with influencers can be an additional avenue to shape conversations around digital identity based on cultural and societal norms. <br />Finally, future research should explore the impact of social campaigns led by influencers on actual behavioral change beyond online engagement. In addition, analysis of relevant and measurable actions people took as influenced by influencer outcomes in authentic contexts (e.g., participating in mental health initiatives promoted by influencers, and community-based projects) offers in-depth perspectives on the impact of digital content creators.</p>",

There is further discussion of fans utilising TikTok to enhance their creativity and create new narratives as well as remixing existing ones, according to their own needs.<br />The purpose of this study is to analyse how fans operate and incorporate their own experiences and emotionally invest into characters, as well as creating alternate endings according to what they wish to see. Through content analysis of data found on TikTok, this study applies theories of Jenkins, Coppa and Shiffman to investigate how the fandom works. Data includes fan edits posted by various accounts to grasp the fandom and get an accurate sample, whilst also narrowing down dates of posting to be concise. The data shows that fans are emotionally invested in a tragic and humorous way, and they operate by creating narratives and alternate universes, whilst taking oppositional readings to Canon narratives. Further, this fandom has delved deeper into underrepresented characters and have filled the gaps that the Harry Potter movies had left out, evidencing a proactive and emotionally invested fandom, who regularly partakes in extensive digital labour. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 INTRODUCTION<br />The Harry Potter movies became a global success as soon as they hit the screens, making over 9 billion dollars in revenue altogether against a one-billion-dollar budget (The Numbers, n.d). They are, to this day, popular amongst a vast majority of age ranges. This is evident through the existence of media texts such as user generated content across social media platforms such as TikTok and Wattpad (TikTok, n.d; Wattpad, n.d). Fifteen years after the release of the last movie and due to technological advancements, such as TikTok, this content is like a cycle; it attracts new audiences while is repeatedly posted throughout the day. The for-you page (Harry Potter, TikTok) has edits posted throughout the day- something I have observed over the past few months. Furthermore, TikTok and other social media platforms allow audiences to create content they enjoy and focus on their favourite characters. <br />Over the years, TikTok operators have pointed out how &ldquo;Draco Tok&rdquo; (which is content focused on Draco and the hashtag has helped make it more popular) as well as the Marauders (a prequel of Harry Potter) has become popular online. The Marauders are the previous generation of Harry Potter and content that was not shown in the movies is regularly created on TikTok by fans. The fan pages have gained following in recent years, with many having over ten thousand followers and millions of likes and shares (Mooneycardigan, 2024 &amp; TikTok, n.d). <br />In this dissertation I will be discussing the Harry Potter fandom, how they operate and utilize TikTok as a platform to share their creativity, as well as how content created may have relatable elements. <br />To answer my question in depth, I will be breaking down the question into four different sections of themes: emotional edits, humorous edits, fan narratives of Hermione and Draco, and the Marauders. I will focus on how the fandom operates by creating these edits, what they signify, and how they may be relatable to the fandom. <br />For example, Fans create TikTok&rsquo;s that position Draco in a place of empathy showing him as an isolated young person and the hashtags make this content more visible. This is a key aspect of my research as Draco is seen as an unlikable character in the books/movies, however fans have found to dive deeper into his character and explore more (Coppa, 2006). <br />I will be focusing on various key theorists such as Jenkins, Fiske and Coppa, Hall and theories on adoring audiences (Lewis, 2002) for my data analysis to conduct in-depth research on the fandom. The key objective here is to find out how the fandom operates, and what aspects they may find relatable in characters. <br />These reception studies will help understand how audiences receive the messages in the movies and how they decode them. For example, some data may show that fans decide to ignore the messages and receive a completely different meaning. i.e., a scene from the movies focusing on Ron and Hermione may be translated as a scene for Draco and Hermione who are a couple loved by fans (Helena, 2024). <br />I will also focus on the different technique&rsquo;s fans use to create higher engagement and build communal bonds such as utilizing popular hashtags like #ProngsFoot and #Dramione to boost their videos to similar algorithms. <br />TikTok is a vital aspect for this research and one of the best choices, as there is a vast majority of people on it (over 2 billion). The fandom on TikTok consists of high numbers of edits created by fans, and content is regularly posted. Scheeler (2017) argues that adolescents have a stronger connection to popular culture, and this connection is stronger in the Harry Potter movies, perhaps due to most genres covered. Therefore, TikTok acts as a perfect platform to study this subgroup and investigate how they operate.</p>\n<p>2 AIMS, OBJECTIVES AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br />The research question I am working with is, &ldquo;How does the Harry Potter fandom operate and create relatable content on TikTok?&rdquo; The key aim is to investigate which Harry Potter fandom finds relatable aspects in it, and how they express those online via TikTok. <br />My objectives are to apply a range of scholarly literature such as Jenkins and Coppa to analyse my case study and understand how fandom has become active prosumers whilst utilizing new technology to the best of their ability to show their dedication. There is a large amount of data about Harry Potter fandom available that discusses a wide variety of different aspects of the fandom, such as self-narratives and fans becoming proactive by Jenkins and Coppa in a theoretical perspective. <br />By conducting this research, I add to the existing content while analysing specifically how these different aspects of fandom have a reason for creating their content. Additionally, I aim to discuss how certain aspects of characters are relatable such as the tragic arc of Snape sacrifices, and how that may lead to fans creating content centred around them. I will do this by using Baym and Shiffmans work to analyse the content I have found on TikTok. I aim to discuss the need to memorialize characters of the fandom such as the previous generation of Harry Potter (Marauders) and how fans may pay tribute to them by creating nostalgic content that requires extensive fan labour, as some key scenes (such as the past generation of Harry Potter) from the books have been omitted or reduced in the movies. <br />I further aim to find content on alternate endings created by fans, using it to discuss how this is a result of taking an oppositional reading to the existing content. Finally, I aim to showcase how fans have used existing narratives from the books alongside similar ideas from the redemption arc of Snape as the anti-hero to construct similar arcs for Regulus Black and Draco Malfoy, which they felt were missing from the franchise. I do this by using Coppa&rsquo;s work on fanfictions discussing how fans choose to focus on other dimensions that have been left unexplored by creators. <br />3 LITERATURE REVIEW</p>\n<p>HOW FANDOMS OPERATE ON TIKTOK<br />Jenkins (2012), and Baker (2015) argue that fans create content and actively engage in becoming part of the community. Jenkins further argues that fans create and engage with existing material and create their own narratives, and that emotional connections may play a role in the content created. Due to advancements in technology, fans have become active in different ways than in the past. However, advancements are not the only reason for this, as fans have always been a creative subgroup, but technology has allowed them to be more creative. For example, Harry Potter fans have shifted from posting content on PotterMore to creating mini movies on TikTok focused on content they enjoy. <br />Participatory culture and fan narratives are a prevalent theme in the Harry Potter fandom- fans create and engage with content they have a liking towards and actively create videos that have connotations of emotional connections and relationships. The official Harry Potter TikTok account has over 4.1 million followers (as I write), and fans regularly repost content, tag them in edits, and use popular sounds from the account in their own work. Fandoms utilize popular hashtags such as #ProngsFoot, #Dramione, and #GoldenTrio, and some tag the official Harry Potter account to enhance their content to other algorithms with similar interests, forming a community bond. Baker further argues that this active participation helps foster an identity and community online, which can be seen on TikTok where fans regularly post and engage with each other. Additionally, Jenkins&rsquo; theory is a key aspect of my research, as it will give deeper insight into how fandoms work and how the Harry Potter fandom operates on TikTok and engages with content, whilst also creating their own personal narratives with the help of technology.</p>\n<p>EMOTIONAL CONNECTIONS IN FAN GENERATED CONTENT<br />Baym (2000, 2015) discusses the importance of online spaces for fans to use to create content that they have an emotional connection with and allows them to express what they feel. This is crucial for this research as TikTok has been used as a tool for the fandom to express and highlight the narratives they are fond of. Coppa (2006) further builds upon the idea of Jenkins and how content created by fans is a form of emotional expression and further argues that fans connect with the content they create. <br />Although her main discussion is regarding fan narratives, it may be used to discuss the importance of fans connecting with content. Additionally, Shiffman (2014), Milner (2013) and Duffet (2013) discuss the importance of emotions within fandoms and how they can encourage participation. Bahn et al. (2017) and Scheeler (2017) discuss the importance of emotional connections in creating new content and how they help to construct the ideas audiences would like to see. This connection can motivate audiences to recreate experiences through their favourite popular culture and express themselves more freely. The everyday struggle of characters in Harry Potter or their personal traits may be aspects that audiences relate to in their day-to-day lives and therefore try to recreate those moments in their narratives. Scheeler further discusses that the emotional relationship between audience and popular culture is slightly stronger in Harry Potter books, perhaps due to the nature of the characters and the various traits connoted throughout the franchise. Another key theory is &ldquo;adoring audiences&rdquo;. The adoration of content may create a deep sense of emotional connection and fans may find themselves grieving tragic character arcs, or deaths of characters and increase the dedication of fans (Lewis, 2002) and encourage them to participate further. In the case of Harry Potter, this attachment of tragic arcs is mostly seen in the edits of the Marauders and edits focused on the tragic arcs of Snape and Lilly.</p>\n<p>FAN NARRATIVES AND CHANGING MESSAGES AND MEANINGS.</p>\n<p>Fiske (1992) and Coppa (2006) argue that fans are very creative and active subgroups and place an emphasis on participation. Fiske further argues that fans recreate content that is already available to them and find new messages and meanings within that content by reworking popular culture. Therefore, the media is reshaped according to their wishes and needs. This can be clearly seen through the TikTok accounts dedicated to the Marauders (a prequel of Harry Potter) and Draco and Hermione&rsquo;s relationship, which is something that became popular within the fandom, perhaps due to the chemistry the actors shared off-screen and a very popular ship &ldquo;Dramione&rdquo; has been created where Draco is placed as an anti-hero, sacrificing his love; the narrative is completely changed from the actual stories according to the dimension fans wanted to see. Both self-narratives are an example of textual poaching (Jenkins, 2012) and fans pay attention and find content that fits exactly their own visualized narratives. Coppa additionally discusses how fans tend to discover the dimensions of characters that have remained untold by the author and utilize their creativity to explore these dimensions (such as the arc of Draco&rsquo;s trauma and the pressure he faces from his parents). Hellekson and Busse&rsquo; (2014) argument further align with Coppa, and they discuss how fans take canonical texts and take their own meanings and may even dislike the original. They use technology for their advancement and over the years this has led to fanfiction changing drastically, where fans take some narratives into their own hands. This is evident in the case of Draco and Hermione&rsquo;s ship where many fans dislike that she ends up with Ron and therefore take advantage of their creativity to create an alternate ending. <br />The last theory I will be using in this section is Halls reception theory who argues that there are three different readings that the audience take from a text by decoding the messages present: hegemonic, negotiated and oppositional (Hall, 1993). He argues that in the last reading audiences may choose to ignore signs and interpret the meaning in a completely different way than intended by the producer. Martin (2007) further builds upon this and argues that this leads to fans creating their own versions of the text they have interpreted. This is again, evident in the Draco and Hermione trope. These theories are essential to this research as it helps to analyse the content that the Harry Potter fandom regularly posts that is not present in the books/movies (such as Dramione and clips of the marauders generation).</p>\n<p>ONLINE SPACES AND DIGITAL LABOUR<br />Deller (2016) argues that online spaces give fandoms the space to come together as subgroups and form a community of people who foster similar behaviours, acting as a congregational space. Further, they can create a sense of identity together. TikTok facilitates this by allowing fans to communicate with each other by sharing and reposting content and commenting on content they like. These positive or encouraging comments can help give the fandom participants a sense of belonging. Bury (2005) additionally discusses how an online space can help construct ideas that fans have a liking towards. Chidi-Ogbolu (2024) and Kanai (2018) further evidence this; fans work online for love and not wages. They connect with content based on their own unique experiences and those with similar experiences also connect to this content, audiences must find this content themselves and those who put in the work- are doing fan labour; further argues that relatability is a key aspect of digital labour, and a major part of creating content. Fortner and Fackler (2018) and Mcfarlene (2012) further argue how new technology has allowed us to form communities online and allows people to come together, and how it has aided in the creativity of fans. This advancement allows people to become more interlinked without the need to have to physically meet and this is further evidenced by Crysel et al. (2015) who argues that the Harry Potter fandom has extended beyond just social media; they partake in activities that relate to the fandom and share their experiences together. <br />Advancements in technology have also allowed fandoms to evolve and expand their content further than what is already available, by making use of AI. Many videos use AI to create voice-overs of the narratives they wish to see and edit videos to reshape content and find new meanings. Furthermore, fans use this new technology in a more creative way too by creating new narratives that may have been missing in the books. For example, many videos posted on TikTok (Helena, 2024) include AI voiceovers of Draco and Hermione which makes the fan narrative seem more genuine. Technology has been utilized to aid the popular &ldquo;Dramione&rdquo; ship that fans adore.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />4 RESEARCH DESIGN <br />The research design of this project included qualitative data to investigate how the Harry Potter fandom operates on TikTok, creates content that is relatable to themselves and other audiences. I used qualitative data and conducted content analysis on Harry Potter fan edits to identify the underlying themes and narratives present in the fandom. Harry Potter is a relevant case study as the fandom has been very active since the release of the movies, and the movies remain popular to this day. This ties in perfectly with the theories I have used such as Jenkins and Coppa. Additionally, the characters in the movies have been written by Rowling with great depth, which allows me to apply notions of emotional resonance and connections with the audience (Anderson, 2017). <br />I had chosen to focus on 4 different themes that are most popular on the app: emotional edits, humorous edits, and fan narratives. The first theme focused on tragedy/melancholic emotion and how tragic arcs have been portrayed in fandom. This relates to theories that discuss the importance of emotional connections in content that fans create and how they use their content as forms of expression (Scheeler, 2017 and Baym, 2000).<br />The second narrative focused on parody and memes and how fans may find elements of relatability in these memes. The third theme was focused on an alternate universe created by fans, mostly derived on self-narratives/fanfiction that relates to Hermione and Draco (Dramione) and applies directly to Coppas work on fanfiction (Coppa, 2006). <br />The fourth narrative focused on scenes missing from the movie that fans wished to have seen but were not as highlighted in the story, such as the previous generation of Harry Potter and the characters that had more depth in the books, and some depth that fans themselves had added through head canons. This applies to theories of adoring audiences (Lewis, 2002) as well as digital labour (Ogbolu, 2024) that fandoms put in to create content that they find missing. <br />I have used a sample of around 50 edits on TikTok that include key scenes from the movies with higher fan engagement to evidence my research. The engagement such as comments has also been used to discuss the impact on fans where visible, as well as how they react on some of the content posted. <br />By using TikTok I was able to get a wider range of data as there is a larger and younger population present on the app, and it is mainly the platform used for fan videos due to its unique editing features. <br />I used data from the start of 2022 to the end of 2024 to get a more concise and recent sample, which allowed me to discuss the advancements of technology and how the Harry Potter fandom has utilized this. TikTok has recently added new editing features and allows longer videos as compared to a few years ago, so this recent sample allows me to discuss how technology has helped creativity of fans. <br /> Additionally, I used content analysis for the edits to see the visuals, such as specific music, editing style, and colour palette in each theme of edits, and how these visual aspects enhance relatable traits of characters for the fandom. Content analysis assisted my research in identifying videos that fit the narratives I had chosen and the key aspects prevalent in them. For example, the consistent use of water and the green colour pallet palette for edits concerning Regulus connotes his death and sacrifice due to being a Slytherin. Looking for consistent themes in edits was a key part of my data collection as it helped evidence what aspects are important for fans and what they symbolise.</p>\n<p>Further, the non-diegetic soundtracks helped identify the emotions portrayed in edits and the use of different camera angles aided in identifying how characters have been positioned in narratives, and the colour palette helped identify the melancholic and humorous edits. Furthermore, I was able to analyse the different relationships/character arcs fans have discovered in their content and how they have been represented. This helped to discuss the different aspects fans may find relatable. For example, in the movies/books Snape is portrayed as a strict teacher throughout the movies, with focus on his past with Lily towards the end. However, fans delve deeper and expand on these tragic aspects of Snape which may indicate they resonate with those feelings more which is also reflected in their content (Baym, 2000).</p>\n<p>Lastly, I included scholarly research to evidence my data and further investigate the content found on TikTok, as well as apply theory in depth. Several theoretical frameworks such as Jenkins fandom theory and Baym&rsquo;s theory of emotional connections with the content fans generate, were used to support the data found. Jenkins fandom theory has been central to this dissertation as it discusses the way fandoms operate online and actively take part in creating content that they find relatable aspects in. Harry Potter is one of the best fandoms to apply this theory as it is a global fandom that is constantly growing. Further research (Anderson, 2017 and Sveinsd&oacute;ttir, 2015) was used to discuss how the movies have created characters that have many relatable aspects to the fandom and how this is reflected in the content the participants of this fandom create. The Harry Potter fandom is a very relevant case study, as the franchise became a global phenomenon, being popular to this day. It is one of the most engaged and active fandoms, which gives a wide range of data to include. Further, the franchise is timeless and taps into universal aspects that many people identify with, which allows me to investigate further into which arcs fans find relatable. <br />One limitation I faced while conducting this research was finding an accurate and concise sample. Due to the vast majority of videos present, at times it was difficult to place them into a significant theme as they portrayed more than one issue. Fans also tend to remove or delete content, which sometimes results in lost data. This was hard to locate again or find an alternative to. <br />Additionally, to ensure everything is done in an ethical manner, I ensured all videos and edits I found were correctly cited with all information needed as well repeating this process for all the readings and theories I had found. <br />Lastly, relatability can be subjective and varies from person to person. So, I had to work with videos that mostly contained universal emotions such as tragic endings, humour and nostalgia, as well as ensure I conducted my analysis in a precise and accurate way to understand the intended messages and meanings of the texts.</p>\n<p><br />5 DATA COLLECTION/FINDINGS <br />ATTACHMENT THROUGH TRAGEDY AND MISUNDERSTANDING <br />In this theme, The Harry Potter fandom operates on TikTok by creating and sharing content they may have a connection with and find aspects of relatability in. This spans from existing narratives within the movie, such as the backstory of Snape, and how he had to lead a double life as an agent and eventually lost Lily, who was his ex-best friend whom he had loved. Here a character with many layers and depth has been created, which allows a large audience to empathize with them and form emotional bonds (Anderson, 2017 and Sveinsd&oacute;ttir, 2015). Sveinsd&oacute;ttir additionally discusses the fairy tale structure of the movies, and this allows a wider range of audiences to find elements to connectivity and resonance with the character arcs. <br />One of the most predominant themes in the Harry Potter fandom was emotional edits and a vast majority of them focused on Snape. These edits focus on his suffering and sacrifices, forming a deep connection with the audience, and allowing fans to see themselves in him more, which can be seen through the comments that are focused on fans&rsquo; emotions (Bahn, et al, 2017). Fans who may have experienced similar feelings of loneliness or being misunderstood are more likely to understand these aspects of Snape&rsquo;s character that trigger these emotions<br />(Rum, 2023), Figure 1 (Snape, 2023), Figure 2 (Penguin, 2023) Figure 3<br />Snape&rsquo;s complex character arc allows fans to feel sympathetic to his tragic past alongside the unrequited love for Lily. Figures 1 and 2 use a low angle shot to portray Snape as a hero-like figure, allowing him to appear in a position of power with light shining on one side of his face (Figure 1). In Figure 2 this is juxtaposed with his dark clothes, portraying the split life he has been living. Additionally, the caption in figure 1 \"say yes to me&rdquo; portrays Snape&rsquo;s one-sided love and further enhances the narrative of the one-sided lover that fans have delved deeper into, as compared to the strict teacher seen in the movies. <br />Figure 2 uses a symbolic scene of Snape revealing his identity of being the half-blood prince whilst using a wand, reinforcing the power he holds as well as the darkness he has been surrounded by joining Voldemort. This imagery may be decoded as a metaphor for fans who have gone through similar situations of being surrounded by problems in their personal lives and who may have felt the need to suppress or hide parts of their identity. This could allow them to relate to this aspect of Snape the most and may be a reason for incorporating it into their content (Milner, 2013). Figure 3 focuses on a similar theme of misunderstanding and secretiveness, which has been anchored with a blue and black colour pallet to enhance the themes. The use of the song &ldquo;love it and hate it at the same time&rdquo; may further reinforce the dual identity he is living, as well as the love/hate he has for Lilly whilst acting as a double agent for Voldemort. <br />This is further anchored by repeated zoom shots of Snape with melancholic expressions which are used throughout the edits alongside the scene of him hugging Lily for the last time. The dialogue &ldquo;Always&rdquo; from the last movie is also high in frequency and has become a popular addition to edits relating to Snape. This dialogue has been treated as very symbolic and often relates it to more than just his relationship with Lily, and to the wider fandom and how they will &ldquo;always&rdquo; be dedicated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(Edits, 2023)<br />Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 6<br />These figures highlight the empathetic comments left under edits depicting Snape&rsquo;s tragic arc, supporting the idea that fans become emotionally invested in narratives that resonate with their personal experiences.<br />The high number of likes and comments may show that fans have melancholic feelings for Snape and may be able to feel empathy for his character. Further, the fandom mostly focuses Snape edits on emotion and tragedy, highlighting that they may have faced similar situations in real life and use their creativity to express their emotions (Baym, 2000). Baym further argues that personal experiences have a major effect on the content fans tend to create, and it often reflects their personal lives, which may be seen in figures 1 &amp; 2 that focus solely on Snape&rsquo;s tragic story. The low lighting/sombre atmosphere in these edits simulate a sense of isolation which increases feelings of personal ion and may find themselves grieving the losses Snape goes through (Hautsch, 2023). Hautsch further argues how fan generated content is an emotional experience, and it is inspired by the cultural environment of the creators, and this may be seen in this theme, where fans are creating their content, as a means of emotional expression. <br />In these edits, fans provide an outlet to explore the character of Snape beyond his surface-level portrayal as a strict teacher and delving further into his life with Harry&rsquo;s past, which was only mentioned in the last movie towards the end. However, fans have expanded in depth on this aspect of Snape. This is evident in figure 1 where he is seen dishevelled after finding out about the death of Lily. This leads to a stronger attachment from fans who relate to his struggles (Bury, 2005). Feelings of redemption and grief may be universally felt with audiences as edits are very popular, with engagement reaching as high as 20 million views. This is a different representation as compared in the books/movies where Snape is seen merely as a bully and only in the last movie does the audience see the sacrifices he has made. However, the edits place him in place of an anti-hero, like Draco, who has much more to him. This engagement and creativity from the fandom align with Jenkins theory (Jenkins, 2012) where fans have become producers and are creating content, they may have emotionally connecting with. Jenkins further argues that fans share content and participate in fandoms as they feel understood and have a safe space to share their content woven with their personal experiences. Fans also reshare the media as part of the passion they hold for their fandom, which can be evidently seen through this theme of edits. Further, Kelley (2021) discusses how fans see themselves in narratives, and it is not just about the original canon content. This creates a pro-active community that is deeply rooted in emotions. According to Kelley, emotions can be difficult to define but are generally seen as excitement, or an agitation of mind. The fandom therefore uses their creativity to share their personal lives with the rest of the community.</p>\n<p>HUMOROUS EDITS AND SOCIAL RELATABILITY<br />In the second theme, fans operate by creating humorous edits that may create a social connection and communal bond with the rest of the fandom. Fans frequently comment on how these humorous moments reflect their personal friendships, with some expressing that these edits remind them of their best friends and the fun experiences they share. This high engagement from fans and comments about personal stories is likely to create a positive environment which may encourage them to create more content and form online relationships with the fandom (Crysal et al, 2015). <br />Most of these edits use upbeat music and a light colour palette, connoting humour and a light-hearted atmosphere. The editing style used is fast paced, with a montage style supported by scenes from the earlier movies highlighting the innocence and carefree moments of Harry and Ron. This showcases the innocent nature of the friendship during their early years. The humorous edits form a binary opposition (Strauss, 1974) to the emotional/tragic edits.<br />where the audience is placed in a position to take a liking and form a social sense of relatability where they may have similar experiences with friends. These binary oppositions complement each other, and in the case of humour, they explore genuine realities of life such as school and relationships. <br />Strauss argues that different meanings are formed through this contrast between the opposing themes. This opposition helps to create depth, and differentiation within the fandom, and other dimensions offered for the fandom, opposing the melancholic story arc but still deep rooted in relatability. This also showcases the emotional range of the fandom; perhaps they may come to these humorous edits after the edits that are focused predominantly on Snape. <br />Emphasis on satirical situations and key aspects of the characters such as Ron&rsquo;s awkwardness and Hermione&rsquo;s strict nature from the movies has been a repeated theme within these edits. This is seen in figure 5, where fans are exaggerating these situations, supported by (usually) additional captions to add to comedic effects. The typography utilized consists of chunky font (Figure 5) supported with brighter colours such as neon red and yellow, connoting the childlike atmosphere of the three protagonists and further reinforcing the humorous and carefree situations. This exaggeration is enhanced using magic in a daily life routine, to connote the authentic aspects of the trio, and this creation of memes allows the fandom to spread and communicate their feelings (Capa, 2023). Capa also argues how memes are a form of expression and can allow audiences to be as creative as possible. <br />Figure 4 shows Harry and Ron using a cloak to sneak into places they should not, reinforcing the chaotic relationship between the two, while also allowing audiences to draw parallels between the films and their own experiences, such as youths entering places they should not during school years, reinforcing the coming of age narrative Rowling has created, and how it allows a wide range of people to interpret the scenes according to their own experiences (Anderson, 2017). For example, adolescents of the same age as Harry and Ron may feel aligned with this scene as it may be something they have done during their school years.</p>\n<p>(Zoe, 2022), Figure 7 (Bree, 2024), Figure 8 (Zoe, 2022), Figure 9<br />The humour-focused edits such as Figure 7, often capture the playful, supportive nature of Harry, Ron, and Hermione&rsquo;s friendship. Some edits are focused on Hermione&rsquo;s strict nature and the sibling-like dynamic of the Trio, where Hermione is portrayed as the &ldquo;strict one&rdquo;. This relatability may foster a strong sense of attachment, as viewers project their own experiences onto the characters' interactions (Baym, 2000). This allows fan to bond over the situations depicted in the edits, creating a parasocial relationship with the characters of Ron, Hermione and Harry as they may feel connected with their imperfections, and feel a sense of community where they can share their experiences together. <br />Fans may feel they have a strong relationship with these characters as their relatable traits may foster a personal connection, which is known as a parasocial relationship (Tran, 2023). Tran builds on participatory culture, discussing how memes and relatable aspects of characters can help build these parasocial relations and foster a sense of identity with the characters, which is seen through the comments below, where fans regularly comment about the dynamics of the trio.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Zoe, 2022 <br /> Figure 10 Figure 11<br />Additionally, humour is a universal emotion (Shiffman, 2014), and meme content allows audiences to share and recreate the experiences they may have had in these videos. Audiences may take a liking to this light-hearted depiction of the franchise, expressed in the form of meme content. Shiffman further argues that memes are a form of expression which builds emotional connection. This can be seen through the high interaction of these edits that create an online community. This satirical depiction may also allow fans to foster a different type of attachment to the characters. Figure 7 utilizes a humorous situation which anyone watching may find comedic. This highlights the awkward situations and lowers the barriers to the fandom, where many audiences may be able to relate to such behaviours. However, Figure 8 uses scenes from the movie that only fans themselves could relate to, creating an inside joke allowing bonding within the community (Kim &amp; Kim, 2017). These edits also showcase the generational difference and how Gen Z portrays and interprets humour differently, using modern terminology such as &ldquo;chaotic&rdquo; and [gen z term] to interpret the humour in Harry Potter.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(Blangva, 2024)<br />Figure 12 Figure 13 <br />An example is shown in figure 12, and the fans reactions to this meme (Figure 13) further remixing the content by adding themes such as C.AI and writing emails. These further ties the dark scene into a normal life routine. The creators&rsquo; own caption has been added to a scene referring to a dark theme such as magic and death, however the caption turns the narrative into something funnier and creates dark humour. The comments can be seen interpreting the scene very differently and adding elements such as AI to the diary, which is very different to how an older audience would view the scene, and bond over this together. Although a darker colour theme has been used the music and caption change the meaning of the original text, creating something satirical (Vinokurova, 2021). Vinokurova also discusses that memes are a mixture of symbols and text that create something &ldquo;witty&rdquo;, and that the advancements in technology can allow individuals online to be more creative. This further evidence Shiffman&rsquo;s (Shiffman, 2014) argument as he discusses that fans will interpret popular culture on their own terms which can lead to the creation of memes. This remix of canon and modern-day trends create a playful media text, which encourages engagement and allows the fandom to experiment and bond over what they create.</p>\n<p>3RD NARRATIVE- ALTERNATE UNIVERSE OF HERMIONE AND DRACO- FAN NARRATIVE</p>\n<p>In this third category fans operate by creating content that they wished to see such as the relationship of Hermione and Draco. The fans create parallel universes where they can take charge of the story. This content also highlights relatable notions such as broken or strained relationships, which may represent the lived experiences of the fans.</p>\n<p>The key theme here is Hermione/Draco&rsquo;s relationship which is a fan narrative, not present in the books or movies. Edits such as these focus on key scenes from the films such as a head shot of Draco standing alone in low lighting in front of a mirror, followed by a zoom shot of melancholic expression. Editing involves zoom shots of Hermione with similar expressions that have been merged to make it seem as they are together, with the help of AI to make it look extremely realistic. The dark colours portray them as a hidden, and strained couple unable to stay together due to Draco&rsquo;s identity of being a &ldquo;death eater&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br /> (Becky, 2024), Figure 14 (Helena, 2024), Figure 15<br />Most of these edits (such as figure 6) feature dark lighting, slow paced editing and a sombre atmosphere has been created which is enhanced by romantic non-diegetic soundtracks such as Lana Del Ray. The slow transitions are symbolic of their relationship and how it has evolved over the year and the use of Del Rays music further enhances a slow burn trope. (Helena, 2024).</p>\n<p>Zoom shots in Figure 15 show Draco looking towards Hermione with the non-diegetic soundtrack with the lyrics focused on &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my eye on You&rdquo; and reinforces a broken relationship. The unconventional pairing offers an alternative story where two enemies become lovers (which is a popular trope in romance stories) which has been created by fans. The aspect of Hermione and Draco is also one that was slightly touched upon by Rowling in The Goblet of Fire and so fans have utilized their creativity to tap into a different dimension of their relationship, while they subvert the intended meaning of Hermione and Ron in a much more immersive way (Coppa, 2006). Coppa further discusses how fandoms have always been an active subgroup that like to discover different aspects and bring their creativity to life through fanfiction, which is very evident here.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Dramione&rdquo; (Draco and Hermione&rsquo;s ship name) been a popular couple since the beginning of the franchise which has grown beyond TikTok. With the use of AI fans have been able to breathe life into other dimensions of the character of Draco, such as a redemption arc showcasing relatable emotions such as guilt and grief. Most edits use #DracoTok in their content to highlight and increase viewership. This allows the algorithm to enhance the performance of the videos and gain more views, leading to more popularity of the couple and the characters.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, fans are putting life into a relationship that does not exist in the original text. AI voiceovers allow the fans to create immersive and realistic content where they are no longer dependent on the original movies to show what they like (Jenkins, 2012) but instead they can use technology to manipulate the endings as well as creating an alternate universe (AU), which has become very widespread online.</p>\n<p>This deep-rooted emotional investment may stem from their own experiences and creates the need to reshape existing narratives. Hall (1993) argues, that in some instances audiences may choose to ignore messages and decode their own meaning. In this case, it is evident that fans have chosen to ignore the hegemonic reading of Hermione and Ron being together, but instead create a parallel universe, and provide meaning for those who may feel connected to this alternate ending. This can be further evidenced by the caption added- the only ending I will accept which shows the strong emotional resonance they have with the fan created alternate ending.</p>\n<p>These alternate endings may be fuelled by personal experiences of audiences facing similar strained relationships and encourages them to take an opposed readings and create something that they are able to connect to (Scheeler, 2017). The trope that has been used is very popular and many young audiences may find themselves going though similar situations which may encourage them to show the aspects they have an emotional connection through an online platform (Baym, 2000).</p>\n<p>Figure 15 utilizes an AI voiceover of Draco admiring Hermione, supported by edited scenes from the sixth movie, bringing the relationship to life. Many pieces of fiction have been written on the two, such as a popular Wattpad story &ldquo;Manacled&rdquo;- an alternate universe where Voldemort takes over and Draco and Hermione are together. The love for this has grown over several platforms and other fans have even gone as far as printing and binding the Wattpad story of Manacled, adding pictures and showing their dedication on TikTok. Content has been brought over to TikTok, and the fandom has breathed life into the story. This highlights the changes in technology and how narratives are spread across multiple platforms (Zie, et al,2024).</p>\n<p>4TH THEME- MARAUDERS FANDOM: NOSTALGIA AND UNDERREPRESENTED CHARACTERS</p>\n<p>Another sample of 10 edits show the fandom operating by putting digital labour into their edits by reworking pieces of popular culture and representing the missing scenes of the previous generation of Harry Potter, also known as the Marauders- the parents of Harry Potter and their friends. A range of different themes have been posted, showing fans&rsquo; dedication to seeing the different dimensions of the franchise. These edits follow a slightly similar theme to emotional edits relating to Snape. <br />The reason for creating these edits could be slightly different as compared to the other themes I have discussed, as fans may be driven by the lack of representation (Seymour, 2018). However, the themes portrayed in them such as nostalgia, relationships and tragedy may still resonate with the audience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(Sirius Apologist, 2023), Figure 16<br />Figure 16 shows a shot of Aaron Taylor Johnson, picturized as James, in the scene where he dies alongside Lily (this shot is repeated several times across the edits, marking the end of their lives). This is anchored by the voiceover from the books, creating an upsetting and gloomy environment. This is further enhanced using vintage style font across the edit, reinforcing the older time frame and giving the fandom a chance to memorialize and cherish their favourite characters. The left edit has been carefully curated with scenes of other popular culture, recreating the scene of James and Lilys death, with melancholic music, reinforcing the tragic ending of the couple (Lewis, 2002). Lewis further discusses how fans may become devoted to popular culture, and this may lead to them feeling genuine loss over the deaths of their favourite characters. This can be seen through these edits, which have become a symbolic conduit for collective sadness and offer the fandom a space to regulate and express their emotions over a largely underrepresented character in the movies. Driven by devotion and the desire to pay tribute to these underrepresented characters in the original texts, fans memorialise these characters. This has been done by combining popular culture with the original text reinforces Jenkins idea of textual poaching, showing how fans use it to express their values and narrative wishes (Jenkins, 2012).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />(M, 2024), Figure 17. <br />Edits such as figure 17 utilize popular soundtracks such as &ldquo;The Poet, The Soldier the King&rdquo; which is a popular soundtrack with vintage style filters to enhance nostalgia and establish connections with audiences through memories. The titles have been assigned to different characters with a focus on zoom shots shifting from Sirius and James highlighting their old friendship and the tragic ending of it, tapping into the memories of audiences and connoting reminiscent aspects of their relationship, by reworking pieces of other popular culture (Fiske, 1992). This clearly exemplifies what Fiske argues and how fans have used their editing techniques to develop and create a sub fandom that was never fully explored in the original narratives.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(Pri, 2023), Figure 18 (Via, 2024), Figure 19 (Pri, 2024), Figure 20<br />Figures 18, 19 and 20 show edits on the Marauders and how the cast has been carefully chosen by the fandom to match the descriptions from the movie. This also shows fans&rsquo; desire for preservation of their favourite characters although they have not been shown in depth. It is evident a lot of fan labour (Ogbolu, 2024) and research has gone into these videos and cast members have been carefully chosen by fans- for example, Aaron Taylor Johnson has been cast as James Potter and videos from his early movies have been chosen to reinforce a younger and carefree look, with snippets of him in uniform reinforcing his student status. Similarly for Remus Lupin, Andrew Garfield has been chosen who has a popular image in the media of an empathetic saviour from his role of Spiderman. This collective decision of casting members and creating content allows a sense of community to foster (Crysel, et al 2015) and fans constantly use popular hashtags such as #ProngsFoot to boost videos to other algorithms, allowing the fandom to grow further. <br />This reinforces the active participation and attention to detail by the fandom. These casting choices also reflect the fans' dedication to preserving and reimagining beloved characters (Kanai, 2018). Kanai further argues that relatability is the key to digital labour hence the desire to create this missing content may stem from fans personal experiences of school and help them express their nostalgia of olden times. <br />Further, digital labour can be seen through the in-depth representation of Regulus Articulus Black, who is represented as Timothee Chalamet, creating headcanons and prequels that have been largely left out of the movies. The captions on the edits (Figure 22) reinforce the desire to have a separate movie for the Marauders, fuelling their creativity to produce in- depth content to substitute for this. Fans believe Chalamet to be the perfect match, drawing parallels from his character in Dune, showcasing his ability to play complex characters such as Regulus. Most edits (figure 21, 22 and 23) place him in similar positions to Snape and Draco, giving him a redemption arc. A similar colour palette of green and black has been used to reinforce his identity as a Slytherin as well as the dilemma of choosing between his house and the right decision. This portrayal of universal emotions such as loyalty and confusion may resonate with the fandom which could be a reason to create them (Sandell, 2022). There is a repeated theme of symbols such as water and the Horcrux further connoting his dilemma and foreshadowing his death. <br />The repetition of Chalamet shown to be walking towards the water reinforces the tragic end he will meet, and the footage has been edited to fit the narrative as closely as possible. (Fan, 2019). Fan further discusses that one of the biggest motivations to create edits can be scenes that are missing, and fans aim to fill this gap as closely as possible. <br />(Javi, 2022), Figure 21 (Javi, 2022), Figure 22 (N!ick, 2023), Figure 23<br />It is also vital to note that it is not only TikTok that has allowed fans to share their art, but they too have always found ways to express their dedication. For example, during the 90s, a website named Leaky Cauldron (The Leaky Cauldron, n.d.) was created. This allowed the fans to share content such as hand-crafted art (drawings and paintings) with the rest of the community. Changes have allowed fans to merely become more creative, not more proactive, as fandoms have always been (Deller, 2016). This further evidences Jenkins theory and the love for Harry Potter and the various characters that has been apparent since the very beginning of the franchise, but advancements have increased creativity.</p>\n<p>6 CONCLUSION<br />To conclude, the Harry Potter fandom is an extremely dedicated fandom that actively participates (Jenkins, 2012), receives messages and meanings and change them according to their own needs. The question that I aimed to answer was how the Harry Potter fandom operates on TikTok and creates relatable content. <br />This participatory culture can be evidenced by the edits of Hermione and Draco where they have a strained and tensed couple which fans have a lot of love for, and some may even be able to relate to them through this content. As argued by Bahn et al, Scheeler and Baym, the reason for creating (and reshaping) content may be that fans have a personal connection, not just the fact they have an oppositional reading to the original text. The high engagement may also reinforce this point with videos reaching as many as 20 million views and over 100k shares.<br />Fans further create relatable content by focusing on universal emotions such as tragedy and grief through Snape, using dark colours and melancholic music tracks, creating a gloomy atmosphere, positioning these characters in a place of empathy, encouraging engagement and perhaps other fans to emote their feelings through similar content (Hautsch, 2023). This answers the aspect of my question concerning relatability, and how fans may be emoting their own personal experiences via this content. <br />Further, the humour shows fans bonding through positive emotions, creating a communal bond and reinforcing aspects of social relatability (Valkurona, 2021). Most scenes used in this theme were videos from Hogwarts school, or the common room where multiple students are shown to have a positive experience, which is anchored by the upbeat music and fast paced editing montages to connote the chaotic relationship between Harry, Ron and Hermione. Shiffman additionally argues that memes are a popular way of expressing humour online and is a universal emotion that allows many people to relate. Fans may resonate with this satire content and see their own lived experiences in the students lives.<br />The third category was that of alternate universes creates bonding through the tensed couple of Hermione and Draco, placing them as a popular &ldquo;book Tok&rdquo; trope of enemies to lovers. This section clearly evidences Coppa&rsquo;s (Coppa, 2006) theory of fanfiction- fandoms are creative and change messages/meanings according to their own beliefs, the outcome of this is fan fiction they create. The creation of this couple and the dedication of the fans reinforces the love they have for the changed narrative they have created, reinforcing their active participation on TikTok. <br />The last category (4th) was of self-narratives which consisted of content fans wished to have seen or wanted to be enhanced, such as the previous generation of Harry Potter (prequel of Marauders), which also contained relatable aspects. In this category fans I found fans are dedicated and adored the Harry Potter content which encouraged them to create edits that pay tribute to characters such Lilly and James (Lewis, 2002). Lewis additionally states that fans may sometimes mourn the death of characters they love which can be seen through the nostalgic and emotional edits of the marauders. These themes of nostalgia and friendships such Remus, James and Sirius may also be an aspect fans connect emotionally with.</p>\n<p>However, it may also be argued that this content has become commercialized, and the fandom may be party driven by the need for likes and follows, instead of just passion and love for the fandom. It can be hard to distinguish between the two whilst searching for content that portrays the love for the fandom. This is further fuelled by monetization where some accounts may be looking for followers not just to build a community, but for financial gain too. <br />Furthermore, as I was working on TikTok to get a more concise sample, there is content that shows additional engagement from fans on other platforms such as YouTube or Wattpad, where engagement may be different, or the type of content may be different. E.g., it is possible that content posted on Wattpad focuses mostly on Alternate universes and less on emotional content. <br />Across all categories, the fandom operates by acting as active producers&mdash;demonstrating Jenkins&rsquo; (2012) theory of participatory culture&mdash;using TikTok as a tool for emotional expression, creative reinterpretation, and community-building. Whether through exploring grief, celebrating friendship, or reshaping canon, these edits allow fans to form deep connections with characters and with each other. Although some content may not be created with the intention of being relatable, it still may have aspects of relatability as the fandoms operates creates content. The fandom also uses the popular platform to create a community online where everyone can express their emotions via this content and build relationships (Crysal et al 2015). </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Seeking to understand how gender plays a role in shaping the nature and intensity of online abuse. Digital media has transformed journalism, increasing accessibility and opportunities for engagement online. However, this transformation has also introduced new forms of violence and harassment affecting female journalists. By using qualitative Critical Discourse Analysis of twitter feeds approach is best suited to answer the research question, as it enables an in-depth examination of how language, power, and gender dynamics operate in online discourse. A fundamental tool for discourse analysis, Fairclough's three-dimensional model allows for a detailed investigation of text, discourse practice, and sociocultural practice.<br />The theoretical framework foundation of this research is liberal feminism which advocates for legal and policy reforms to ensure gender equality in professional spaces including journalism. The research findings showed that UK female journalists faced misogynistic abuse, intersecting factors like race, religion and sexual identity played a role in online abuse towards these female journalists, victim blaming towards female journalists that by them reporting about sensitive topics like the grooming gangs they are contributing to its cause with the aim of discrediting female journalists. Traditional hegemonic gender roles amplify the harassment further and some of them end up getting death threats. However, male journalists only get criticised based on their work and not personal attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. INTRODUCTION<br />Safety of female journalists in the UK is of urgent concern and immediate action need to be taken. In recent years, the rise of social media, particularly X (formerly Twitter) which serves as an online public sphere has opened public debates on different issues exposing journalists to different levels of scrutiny and harassment. Female journalists specifically, experience more personal, targeted, body shaming and gender specific abuse including sexual and death threats. UK context on this issue is little known, shaped by local media traditions, cultural norms and regulations. Despite, the UK&rsquo;s freedom of press tradition, female journalists covering sensitive and controversial topics face high levels of digital hostility raising questions about why female journalists are still at risk and how their safety can be enhanced better. <br />Introduction of new technology has led to the rise of digital journalism. Journalistic routines and traditional methods of distributing news have shifted to accommodate the new digital formats of distributing news leading to the move of news to online spaces. This shift has created values of immediacy, interactivity and participation for digital news (Usher, 2014). Shifting of news distribution to online platforms has created a breeding ground for online bullying and harassment for both male and female journalists. However, female journalists have become the highest victims of online harassment in both sexual and non-sexual ways. According to research done by UNESCO and the International Centre for Journalists in late 2020, found that 73% of female journalists had experienced online bullying (Posetti et al, 2020). Female journalists keep on having a hard time to navigate their personal and professional identities in these online spaces despite encouragement to create more engaging social media content by their newsroom leadership (Bossio &amp; Holton, 2018, p.249).<br />Research done by the guardian newspaper analysing comments on their articles showed that articles written by female journalists attracted more dismissive and abusive comments than those written by male journalists, regardless of what the article is about (Gardiner et al., 2016). UK influential media industry provides context for researching the safety of female journalists in online spaces as most of its media outlets use digital platforms to engage audiences. This influence increases the visibility of UK journalists online increasing exposure to harassment. Online safety bill 2023 work towards holding social media platforms accountable for harmful content (Online Safety Bill, 2023). Nevertheless, these policies do not address the gendered nature of online harassment.<br />Despite the growing acknowledgement about online harassment towards female journalists, there is a notable gap in academic research that examines about online harassment towards UK female journalists. Existing literature and studies look at it in a global or regional perspective overlooking the interplay of the UK dynamics context. Similarly, literature is yet to fully understand how intersectional factors such as race, religion and sexual orientation influence and shape the harassment faced by female journalists. This research aims to fill these gaps by analysing different UK female journalists addressing both the forms of harassment they face and institutional and cultural factors that shape them in online spaces. <br />Primarily this research continues the feminist media studies tradition, building upon scholars who examine how patriarchy manifest in digital communication. The study contributes to the evolving field of digital harassment. The research findings will help policymakers and media organisations in the UK and beyond in safeguarding female journalists. <br />2. LITERATURE REVIEW<br />Liberal feminism provides the theoretical framework for this research. Liberal feminism challenges roles assigned to women in society and private and public injustice. Liberal feminists argue that restrictive gender roles and gender stereotypes control women&rsquo;s lives and need to be curbed through regulations, initiatives and programmes so that women can move into spaces previously dominated by men (Gill, 2007 p.26). Liberal feminism provides an understanding of online harassment toward female journalists as a normal issue but rather a reflection of societal and structural inequalities. This literature review will look at liberal feminism, Friedan (1963) about The Feminine Mystique, Butler (2006) concept of gender performativity, Crenshaw (1989) intersectionality theory, Misogyny, Cyberbullying and Discourse analysis theory Fairclough (2013).<br />2.1 Liberal Feminism<br />Liberal feminism is important for this research because it would advocate for policies and legal reforms to protect female journalists from online gender-based harassment and attacks. Besides that, it will help advocate for a safe online ground and access to digital platforms where they can freely participate and engage without fear of harassment or violence like their male counterparts. This is by championing policies and initiatives that can be used in social media platforms and newsrooms that can protect them. Liberal feminism also fights for institutional reforms within existing structures. This can be applied in this research where media organizations can offer support for female journalists by offering online safety training to female journalists. <br />Liberal feminism theory examines gender roles and inequalities using a conflict approach so that women can have access to male dominated spaces and spheres by fighting gender discrimination, stereotypes and essentialism that says certain qualities are just specifically inborn to the male and female genders (Heilmann, 2011). Liberal feminism can be linked to welfare feminism in this research. Welfare feminists argue that they are not any different from men, yet they are denied opportunities on basis of sex making the government intervene for women positions in the society. Therefore, liberal feminism &ldquo;provides a framework for the development of &lsquo;moderate&rsquo; feminist policies and legislations which can be used&hellip; by government agencies&rdquo; (Beasley, 1999). However, their interests in connection with government are very specific. Liberal feminism is important for this research because it will advocate policies and legal reforms to protect female journalists from online gender-based bullying and attacks. Moreover, it will advocate for a safe online ground and access on social media where they can participate and engage freely without fear of harassment or violence like their male counterparts.<br />2.2 Gender performativity<br />Societal norms and expectations shape and confine women to specific roles aligned to their gender. With the field of journalism being male dominated, female journalist tend to get bullied online more often compared to their male counterparts. This is because the society views them for domestic roles rather than professional spaces, this is what Butler (2006) refers to as gender performativity; the idea that gender is constructed through repeated social actions. Friedan (1963) observation among American housewives in the 1950s and 60s, argues that these women experienced lack of purpose. She critiques the ideology of femininity that put women to the domestic sphere and calls for a re-evaluation of women&rsquo;s roles and the societal structures. Friedan&rsquo;s (1963) argument resonates with the challenges faced by female journalists who try to get into this male-dominated field while trying to conform to societal traditional gender roles. Online spaces reinforce these pressures with misogynistic comments and harassment often targeting women who deviate from the expected norms. However, despite Friedan&rsquo;s (1963) arguments being influential, it just focuses on middle class white women, neglecting the experiences of working-class women and women of colour.<br />2.3 Intersectionality <br />Crenshaw (1989) introduces the notion of intersectionality theory explaining how different forms of oppression such as race, gender, class and sexuality shape the experiences of marginalised individuals. Intersectionality critics the one-sided approach of feminism movements debating that they fail to account and state how different identities like women of colour and LGBTQ+ individuals create unique forms of discrimination. Highlighting how women of colour faced discrimination in workplaces, but the legal system dismissed these cases stating that racism and sexism were not interconnected. Digital age has shown evidence of intersectionality in online spaces where different forms of harassment take place. Online misogyny is not only gender based but also intertwined with racism, homophobia and religious discrimination making female journalists from marginalised communities vulnerable. Posetti et al (2020) found out that women of colour and those were under the LGBTQ+ umbrella faced more abuse compared to other female journalists illustrating how misogyny, racism, queerness and political power structures intersect in online bullying. Some of the female journalists face online bullying because of their sexuality and what they identify with.<br />2.4 Newsroom culture<br />Online gender-based violence against female journalists shouldn&rsquo;t be normalised as a negative effect of digital journalism. &ldquo;&hellip; There should be no room for misogyny and violence in journalism. Social media platforms and governments must protect women journalists from online violence.&rdquo; (Guterres, 2021). Posetti et al (2020) states that most media houses and organisations fail to support female journalists during these attacks but rather place the burden of navigating this online abuse on journalists themselves. Instead of the media houses intervening and protecting female journalists, they are often asked to &ldquo;stay offline&rdquo; or avoid discussing controversial issues online rather than addressing the bullies. Reinforcing the idea that female journalists must conform to restrictive online behaviours to ensure their safety rather than challenging systematic misogyny in digital spaces. Chen et al., (2020), explains that many women journalists interviewed said it was still emotionally draining to deal with these forms of online harassment, and, more alarmingly, they said they had very little to no newsroom support to help them deal with this issue. Since female journalists are not trained to battle with online harassment, Chen et al. (2020) called for more attention to this issue, which is largely one of professional safety, so that female journalists&rsquo; educators and editors can prepare and support women who will experience online harassment and unsafe conditions at some point in their professional careers. <br />Everbach &amp; Flournoy (2007), state that newsrooms function on hegemonic masculine values and norms. This puts female journalists in a dilemma as they can&rsquo;t get support and protection from online bullying and harassment. This is brought about by what Jenkins &amp; Finneman, (2018) refer to as newsroom culture and the ways communication flows through the newsroom. This then decides assignment of news stories and coverage to be carried out by female journalists based on their gender because of the belief that men are better suited for a career in news than women. Women journalists are mainly tailored into soft news stories which rarely make the front page or the primetime news spot, making them promoted much less often than men (Mesmer &amp; Jahng, 2021). <br />2.5 Misogyny<br />Misogyny in online spaces is expressed in different forms like gendered insults, threats of violence and cyberstalking (Jane, 2016). Manne (2017) states that misogyny controls and punishes women who violate traditional gender norms compared to sexism that upholds patriarchal structures. Using Rush Limbaugh's attacks on Sandra Fluke as a case study to illustrate how misogyny often projects personal grievances onto women who are largely unknown to the perpetrator the desire to maintain patriarchal power structures. Jane (2016) introduces the concept of &lsquo;toxic technoculture&rsquo; where online abuse has been normalised to an extent which perpetrators walk away with it without any accountability posing a huge risk for female journalists. Unlike male journalists who get criticism based on their work, female journalists are mostly attacked based on their gender, appearance and perceived role in the society brought about by hegemonic gender norms (Posetti &amp; Shabbir, 2022). In addition to that, female journalists who are from marginalised groups such as race, religion or sexuality also fall victim of this online misogyny (Crenshaw, 1998, p. 314 &ndash; 343). Marwick &amp; Lewis (2017) examine how various online groups manipulate the media in platforms like X (Formerly twitter). The study analyses specific cases, like Gamergate and Pizzagate, to illustrate how these internet trolls and misogynists&rsquo; groups spread their ideologies causing an unsafe ground for female journalists online. However, the report states that determining the intention behind this online abuse is often impossible, especially when participants are anonymous.<br />Duggan &amp; Mason-Bish (2022) discuss the concept of misogyny and its relationship to hate crime, exploring how it is a pervasive form of hatred that is often overlooked in current hate crime frameworks. Current hate crime legislation in England and Wales legally recognizes targeted victimization based on race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or transgender identity. However, gender is not typically recognized as a distinct category for legally recognized hostility. The omission of gender in hate crime analysis obscures women's individual and shared experiences of male violence. A gendered analysis is often left out when examining the rationales behind hate crimes against women, making it difficult to discern the extent to which misogyny informs these crimes. Feminist researchers have long questioned the separation between male violence against women and hate crime arguing that it would be difficult to combine these ideas if gender or misogyny becomes a distinct category of hate crime. Feminist research has exposed the inherently gendered nature of men&rsquo;s violence against women. Misogyny is highlighted as a force sustained by patriarchal structures. Duggan &amp; Mason-Bish (2022) fight for a gender-specific focus on misogyny within hate crime policy because established hate crime categories often focus on men overlooking women experiences. Female journalists often face gendered abuse including online harassment and attacks which can be linked to misogyny. Recognising these acts as hate crimes could provide avenues that protects female journalists in online spaces. However, such legal frameworks are risky and may not capture the nature of misogyny that causes these attacks. <br />Halpin et al (2023) demonstrates the pervasive misogyny within the incel online community by analysing comments in their forum focusing on how members discuss women and their perceived grievances. The findings showed that nearly all active participants employed misogynistic language, frequently targeting women of colour. Members arrive in this forum already holding misogynistic beliefs, rather than developing them there. Does this mean that misogyny is inborn or taught? Incels engage in a \"hybrid masculinity\", positioning themselves as subordinate \"failed men\" while simultaneously engaging in hegemonic practices that subjugate women. This \"weaponized subordination\" allows them to justify their misogyny. Incels demonstrate higher participation in hostile sexism than benevolent sexism, suggesting a shift in sexist practices where hostility is decoupled from benevolence. Female journalists often experience online harassment that reflects the misogynistic language and behaviours found in incel communities. They are also targets of gendered abuse and threats. Like the women targeted in incel discourse, female journalists who report on topics that challenge traditional gender roles or male dominance are often specifically targeted. The dehumanizing language used by incels, like calling women \"foids\" or using \"female\" as a noun, are also found in online attacks against female journalists. This can contribute to an environment that normalizes abuse. The idea that incels engage in \"weaponized subordination\" can inform our understanding of how online harassers may present themselves as victims to justify their abuse.</p>\n<p><br />2.6 Cyberbullying<br />Cyberbullying is a form of bullying that uses technology characterised by perceived anonymity, online disinhibition, the absence of time and space limitations, a large potential audience, the absence of nonverbal clues and the permanence of content (Bauman &amp; Yoon, 2014). Bullying is understood using different theories like; social ecological theory which views bullying as embedded within multiple social contexts. Developmental framework suggests that the need to belong is a major driver of bullying, which manifests differently across developmental. Social cognitive theory explains how individuals can respond to others based on their beliefs. Group process theory focuses on the fact that bullying involves groups, with bystanders playing various roles such as supporters, assistants, or defenders. Cyberbullying applies to online harassment of female journalists. The characteristics of cyberbullying, such as perceived anonymity, online disinhibition, and the permanence of content, worsen the harm experienced by female journalists online. The absence of nonverbal cues makes it difficult to interpret the intent behind messages, potentially leading to heightened anxiety and fear. The enormous reach of online platforms caused by accelerated culture and the permanence of content can amplify the impact of attacks on female journalists.<br />2.7 Counter publics and public sphere<br />Fraser (1990) critics Habermas&rsquo; concept of the public sphere (Habermas, 1992) arguing that the model visualises a single and all-inclusive public sphere where citizens engage to discuss matters of &lsquo;public concern&rsquo; is unrealistic and ignores the problems of real-world. She debates that this model fails to consider societal inequalities and existence of overlapping publics. The public sphere concept is built on masculine norms creating a gender exclusion rather than a &lsquo;woman- friendly&rsquo; space. Fraser (1990) critics Habermas (1992) assumption that discourse should be restricted to deliberation about the common good, and that private interests and issues are always undesirable. What counts as a &lsquo;public matter&rsquo; is decided through discursive argument &ldquo;&hellip; until quite recently, feminists were in the minority in thinking that domestic violence against women was a matter of common concern and thus a legitimate topic of public discourse&hellip; after sustained discursive contestation, we succeeded in making it a common concern.&rdquo; She argues that there is no way to know if a common good exists before deliberation. She debates that the terms \"private\" and \"public\" are often used to delegitimate some interests and valorise others. Fraser (1990) introduces the notion of &lsquo;subaltern counter publics&rsquo; discursive arenas where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counter discourses, which in turn permit them to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs challenging existing power structures. Female journalists face exclusion online echoing Fraser&rsquo;s critic of Habermas about the exclusion of women in public spheres (1990). <br />While the internet may seem open, informal barriers like harassment, intimidation, and threats can effectively exclude women from participating equally. This is crucial for online safety, as the idea that online spaces are \"neutral\" ignores the existing power imbalances that often harm female journalists. Online spaces can be used by female journalists to form supportive networks and to develop ways to counter online abuse and harassment. Counter publics spaces is essential for female journalists to find their \"voice\" and develop the confidence to engage with more mainstream public debates. Fraser (1990) critiques the idea that the public sphere should be limited to the \"common good\" and exclude \"private\" interests, arguing that what counts as a public matter is determined through contestation. This is important in the context of online violence against female journalists, which is often dismissed as a \"private\" matter or personal issue. The text argues against the use of \"private\" as a way of delegitimising certain interests, as those labelled \"private\" are often used to shield things from public scrutiny. By arguing that these attacks are not just \"personal\" but are systematic and a matter of public concern, female journalists can challenge the norms that seek to silence them. Making this is an ongoing argument between different perspectives. The article differentiates between &ldquo;weak&rdquo; publics focused on opinion formation and &ldquo;strong&rdquo; publics that can make decisions.<br />Online spaces often function as \"weak\" publics where journalists share their opinions but do not have the power to change institutional practices. For instance, while online campaigns can raise awareness of online abuse, they might not have the power to compel social media platforms or law enforcement to take more action. Fraser (1990) highlights the need for &ldquo;strong publics&rdquo; that can make authoritative decisions and act on the opinions raised. This translates to calling for policies and practices within journalism organisations, tech companies, and law enforcement agencies that can directly respond to online abuse, and for female journalists to have a safe ground online. Fraser (1990) stresses that participatory parity requires the elimination of social inequality. This connects directly to the safety of female journalists online. As long as gender inequality persists offline, it will inevitably manifest in online spaces. To create safer online spaces, it's crucial to address the broader societal issues that contribute to violence and discrimination against women. The article also points out how social inequality can \"infect\" formally inclusive public spheres, as the \"bracketing\" of inequality does not adequately remove its effects. This article provides a valuable framework for understanding the complexities of online safety for female journalists. It suggests that creating safer online spaces requires more than just technical fixes or increased moderation. It calls for a transformation of existing power structures, challenging the idea of a \"neutral\" public sphere, and giving space for diverse voices and perspectives to address their needs and interests. The arguments for multiple publics, a more inclusive definition of what constitutes a &ldquo;public matter&rdquo;, and stronger, more responsive institutions can provide a pathway to greater safety and inclusion for female journalists online.<br />2.8 Critical discourse analysis theory<br />Discourse analysis is a theoretical and methodological approach that explores how language constructs and reflects power, meaning and identity in society. Discussed by theorists like Foucault (1971) and Fairclough (2013), discourse analysis views language as a powerful mechanism that shapes and is shaped by societal structures rather than just a tool for communication. In this context, discourse does not only include spoken or written language but also visuals as a form of communication. Discourse analysis carries ideologies and power dynamics influencing how people and groups understand themselves and the environment around them. Foucault (1971) concept of discourse emphasizes its role in constructing knowledge and power dynamics, arguing that what we consider &lsquo;truth&rsquo; is influenced by dominant discourses at specific events. Fairclough (2013) builds on the idea of critical discourse analysis by focusing on how discourse reproduces social inequalities. Critical discourse analysis looks into ways language is used to validate or challenge oppression in areas such as media and politics. McLuhan&rsquo;s (1964) idea &ldquo;the medium is the message&rdquo; states that platforms like twitter shape discourse through algorithmic structures. These structures prioritise engagement amplifying controversial content which increases the spread of misogynistic abuse.<br />3. RESEARCH QUESTIONS AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br />This research is guided by the following research questions, aims and objectives. To begin with this dissertation answers this research question; What are the forms of online bullying that female journalists go through and how do they differ from men using the grooming gang scandal in the UK? Seeking to understand how gender plays a role in shaping the nature and intensity of online abuse. The aim of this research is to analyse and compare the difference between the forms of online bullying that female and male journalists go through in UK using the grooming gang scandal contributing to broader discussions about digital safety of female journalists. To achieve the aim stated above, this research will follow these objectives:<br />&bull; Identify and categorise the forms of online abuse faced by female journalists in UK. <br />&bull; In addition to that this research will examine the role of gender and misogyny in shaping online harassment against female journalists, exploring the intersection of gender and politics in shaping the intensity and nature of online abuse.<br />4. METHODOLOGY<br />This methodology section outlines the research design, data collection methods, and analytical approach for investigating the safety female journalists in online spaces. Specifically, it examines the forms of online bullying that UK female journalists experience and how they differ from their male counterparts, using the discourse surrounding the grooming gang scandal in the UK as a case study. The study employs qualitative Critical Discourse Analysis of Twitter feeds to analyse how misogynistic and gendered abuse manifests in digital spaces. By focusing on Twitter discourse, this research explores how online harassment targets UK female journalists covering controversial topics and whether these forms of abuse differ from those faced by male journalists.<br />A qualitative Critical Discourse Analysis of twitter feeds approach is best suited to answer the research question, as it enables an in-depth examination of how language, power, and gender dynamics operate in online discourse. Critical Discourse Analysis provides the theoretical and methodological foundation for this study, allowing for a significant exploration of how discourse support or challenges structural inequalities (Fairclough, 1995). Critical Discourse Analysis is an appropriate method for this research because: It critically examines the relationship between language and power, highlighting how online discourse perpetuates misogyny and gendered violence against female journalists. Besides that, it also helps to identify dominant narratives, discursive strategies, and power relations in digital spaces, particularly regarding controversial topics such as grooming gangs. Lastly, it aligns with feminist media studies, which emphasizes how women in public spaces are subjected to discursive policing and exclusionary practices (Lazar, 2005). Through Critical Discourse Analysis, this research will analyse how online bullying against female journalists differs from that faced by men, exploring the extent to which misogyny, gendered threats, and disempowering tactics shape digital abuse.<br />This study examines Twitter discourse surrounding grooming gangs, as this topic has been highly politicized and talked about by majority of UK journalists both male and female covering the issue. A dataset of tweets, replies, and quote tweets will be collected based on the following criteria:<br />&bull; Tweets authored by female journalists covering grooming gangs particularly those receiving high engagement (retweets, replies, or likes).<br />&bull; Tweets from male journalists covering the same topic for comparative analysis.<br />&bull; Hashtags and keywords related to the discourse, including #groominggangs, #childsexabuse, #rotherhamscandal #pakistanigroominggangs #Telfordgroominggangs<br />Data for analysis was collected for a period of three weeks using the following methods. Firstly, used Grok 3 to prompt and filter journalists who have talked about the grooming gangs scandal in UK. I searched for key terms using twitter search like grooming gangs, Rotherham scandal and rape gangs. From the results of these searches, I will identify specific tweets from different journalists and analyse the comments while preserving user anonymity alongside taking screen shots of specific comments. <br />This study applies Fairclough&rsquo;s (1995) Three-Dimensional Model of Critical Discourse Analysis, which consists of:<br />1. Textual Analysis: Examining linguistic elements in tweets, including word choice, framing, and discursive strategies.<br />2. Discursive Practice Analysis: Investigating how tweets are circulated, responded to, and amplified through digital interactions.<br />3. Social Practice Analysis: Understanding how online discourse reflects broader societal attitudes about gender, media, and power.<br />The grooming gang scandal is a highly contentious issue, which has been trending and discussed recently often used as a political tool by far-right groups to push anti-immigration and anti-Muslim narratives. Female journalists covering the topic frequently face misogynistic abuse questioning their credibility and professionalism, threats and harassment from politically motivated digital actors and narrative weaponization, where their work is misrepresented to fit ideological agendas. This case study aligns with the Literature Review, which examine how online harassment is gendered, politically motivated, and shaped by broader social discourses.<br /> Ethical considerations will be taken into account while conducting this research. To begin with, anonymisation of users from comments to protect their privacy. While Twitter is a public platform, care will be taken to anonymize individual users when quoting tweets. In addition to that, researcher&rsquo;s bias and reflexivity will guide the research. The study will employ a reflexive approach, acknowledging the researcher&rsquo;s position and minimise biasness when analysing data. Lastly, data protection compliance; all digital data will be handled and stored securely following GDPR regulations and ethical guidelines for online research and all screenshots deleted after this research.<br />However, while the methodology is robust, it faces certain limitations; some tweets and comments may not be accessible because they are either hidden or deleted by users which may affect the completeness of the dataset. Changing online trends is also a limiting factor, online harassment patterns evolve quickly, requiring continuous monitoring. Moreover, the research faces an interpretive bias since the analysis and interpretation of data collected is based on the researcher&rsquo;s perspective and understanding of online gendered abuse. Lastly, given the time constrains, the number of tweets analysed may not capture the full extent of online abuse especially from less visible journalists or marginalised communities.<br />This methodology provides a structured approach to investigating the safety of female journalists in online spaces, using Critical Discourse Analysis of Twitter discourse on grooming gangs. Overall, Critical Discourse Analysis provided an insightful framework for examining how language and power perpetuates misogyny and gendered violence against female journalists. By examining how online harassment is gendered, this research contributes to the broader discussion on digital violence, misogyny in media, and journalist safety. The findings will help inform policy recommendations and legal reforms for digital platform regulation, media organization protections, and feminist media advocacy.<br />5. ANALYSIS<br />This section analyses the forms of online harassment faced by UK female journalists compared to UK male journalists who have engaged on the grooming gang scandal discourse in the UK by tweeting or commenting about it on tweeter. The findings are based on screenshot tweets and comments on case studies of well-known female journalists like Julie Bindel, Samantha Smith, Victoria Derbyshire, Paula London, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Bushra Shaikh and Sammy Woodhouse alongside male journalists such as Jimmy the Giant, Stephen Pennell, Charlie Peters, Lewis Goodall and Piers Morgan. This analysis shows key personal gendered patterns in online abuse like sexualised slurs, homophobia, body shaming, racism (colourism), trolling and death threats toward female journalists while male journalists tend to get more of criticism. This difference reveals how online abuse towards female journalists is more rooted in gender dynamics and racial bases, but male journalists face more of criticism rather than intense abuse. <br />5.1 Intersectionality<br />Intersecting social identities such as gender, sexuality and race are some of the forms of bullying extended to female journalists online. A case study of female journalists like Julie Bindel and Bushra Shaikh are a great example of this. Crenshaw&rsquo;s (1989) intersectionality theory emphasizes that oppression caused by overlapping and interconnectedness systems of advantage shape the experiences of marginalised individuals. This theoretical framework is important in understanding the unique nature of abuse these female journalists face based on their identities. For instance, Julie Bindel, a feminist journalist and activist has been a victim of online attacks that target her sexual orientation. One comment stated, &ldquo;By being a part of the LGBTQA community you are a part of the grooming gangs,&rdquo; (see Fig 1) falsely associating her identity with the grooming gangs. Another user dismissed her feminist work by stating, &ldquo;No &lsquo;political lesbian&rsquo; like you is a feminist.&rdquo; (see Fig 2) This kind of comment demonstrate how homophobic and misogynistic interplay (Duggan &amp; Bish, 2022) trying to exclude LGBTQ+ voices from mainstream feminist and journalism discourses.<br />Comments like these result in narrowing of perspectives, reinforcing dominant patriarchal structures on heteronormativity. Similarly, Bushra Shaikh, a journalist of South Asian descent has faced racialised and xenophobic abuse. One of the comments states &ldquo;Go back to Porkistan&rdquo; (see Fig 3) is an intersect of xenophobia and islamophobia which positions her as an outsider. Such kind of comments exclude women of colour from participating in political and journalistic spaces. The deliberate misspelling of &ldquo;Pakistan&rdquo; carries an additional layer of islamophobia mocking religious dietary restrictions. Additionally, Bushra Shaikh has been a victim of racist abuse with comments like &ldquo;You have to cut down on your make up, your skin tone is hiding beneath 2 inches from your face&rdquo; (see Fig 4) and &ldquo;Why do you bleach your skin?&rdquo; (see Fig 5). These comments reflect internal racial hierarchies that position lighter skin as more desirable while also controlling the self-presentation of women of colour. This kind of criticism which combines colourism, gender expectations of beauty and racism asserts that women of colour experience oppression in ways unsimilar to white women forcing them to navigate both gendered and racialised scrutiny creating a chilling effect. Causing lack of diverse perspectives, affecting how stories get told and framed. When analysing these case studies, female journalists face unique racialised, gendered and sexualised attacks compared to their male counterparts covering similar topics. <br /> <br />Fig 1: Screenshot from X<br /> <br />Fig 2: Screenshot from X<br /> <br />Fig 3: Screenshot from X<br /> <br />Fig 4: Screenshot from X<br /> <br />Fig 5: Screenshot from X</p>\n<p>5.2 Misogyny<br />Misogyny operates as a system of punishment and control that targets women who occupy public facing roles, and when they particularly challenge hegemonic patriarchal norms. Female journalists like Samantha Smith, Victoria Derbyshire and Bushra Shaikh are good examples of this based on the comments they get by talking on the grooming gang scandal on twitter (X) revealing how misogyny discourse in online spaces seeks to undermine a woman&rsquo;s right to speak. Manne (2017) argues that misogyny is not only hatred of women, but also a policing mechanism that punishes women step out their &ldquo;lane&rdquo;. Samantha Smith&rsquo;s experience, she gets a comment stating, &ldquo;Allowing women to vote got us here&rdquo; (see Fig 6) such comments illegitimise women&rsquo;s participation in the public sphere suggesting that their presence is an attack to established gender hierarchies with an aim to silence them which could lead to self-censorship. <br />Similarly, Victoria Derbyshire is referred to as a &ldquo;&hellip;bbc nodding dog c**t&rdquo; (see Fig 7) showing how misogynistic language functions as a tool to degrade her moral. This language links to the concept of &ldquo;e-bile&rdquo; where women who engage in public discourse are met with hateful language that reduces them to certain stereotypes or mouthpiece of an imagined liberal agenda (Jane,2014). Additionally, the use of the word &ldquo;c**t&rdquo; a gendered slur reinforces the patriarchal notion that women&rsquo;s voices can be dismissed through sexual or vulgar insults. In Bushra Shaikh&rsquo;s case accusation that she is &ldquo;&hellip;a result of these rape gang culture&hellip;&rdquo; (see Fig 8) reveal the depth of misogyny in online harassment. Engaging in discussions and reporting on the grooming gang topic is being perceived as stepping into male-dominated spheres of crime reporting but also challenging cultural narratives on sexual exploitation. These quotes represent a consistent pattern where female journalists are not only criticised for their viewpoints, but also attacked for existing in spaces traditionally dominated by male perspectives. Facing such extreme form of misogyny has far reaching implications. To begin with, female journalists become self-censored, reducing their online presence. Furthermore, they lose moral, and some avoid participating in controversial topics undermining the principle of press freedom.<br /> <br />Fig 6: Screenshot from X<br /> <br />Fig 7: Screenshot from X<br /> <br />Fig 8: Screenshot from X<br />5.3 Victim blaming<br />Moreover, victim blaming also plays a key role in online abuse towards female journalists in digital environments rooted in broader societal power structures. Victim blaming holds women wholly or partially responsible for the harm that they encounter. In the context of online harassment towards female journalists, victim blaming mostly manifests as an attempt to discredit a female journalist&rsquo;s voice by arguing that her views, stance, identity or political affiliations directly contribute to the issues she reports on, causing a shift away from perpetrators or critical social issues. For instance, comments towards Julie Bindel &ldquo;Women like you are why, and you are oblivious to your impact! (see Fig 9) and &ldquo;&hellip;you are part of the problem.&rdquo; (see Fig 10) this accusation in online harassment where perpetrators rely on insinuations that women cause harm to themselves unknowingly. <br />Victim blaming approach acts as a defensive mechanism where harassers shy away from confronting the real issue grooming gang and system failures by placing the blame on female journalists. Victim blaming in the context of digital harassment aligns with academic literature on gender based online violence. Meanwhile, telling Beth Rigby &ldquo;Go fuck yourself, pedo protector&rdquo; (see Fig 11) assigns her the role of enabler and defender of child sexual exploitation, changing her identity from a critic to a villain. Blaming female journalists for the issues they report about shifts accountability allowing perpetrators evade scrutiny of the public eye. Additionally, it creates a cycle where harassers feel justified in their attacks leaving social structures unchallenged. <br /> <br />Fig 9: Screenshot from X<br /> <br />Fig 10: Screenshot from X<br /> <br />Fig 11: Screenshot from X</p>\n<p>5.4 Gender performativity<br />Comments at Bushra Shaikh such as &ldquo;Cover your hair,&rdquo; (see Fig 12) &ldquo;Hahahaha. A woman not allowed to even enter mosques is teaching other religions about woman respect by concocting imagined issues&hellip;&rdquo; (see Fig 13) and &ldquo;Did your husband let you share this video&rdquo; (see Fig 14) show how female journalists in online spaces are targets of gender policing. Butler (2006) idea of gender performativity states that, gender is not inborn but rather a performance that is accepted through language, social expectations and repeated actions. These comments echo traditional norms on women modesty, marital authority and religious decorum due to Bushra&rsquo;s failure to embrace &ldquo;proper&rdquo; femininity in a cultural context that expects women to remain silent or adhere to certain dress codes. <br />Butler (2006) framework suggests that society define and shape norms of femininity through practices and punishing those who fail to conform to them. &ldquo;Cover your hair,&rdquo; reassert patriarchal expectation that Muslim women must hide their physical features to be accepted in the society. &ldquo;Did your husband let you share this video&rdquo; shows the belief that a woman&rsquo;s freedom of expression depends on male approval, reinforcing gender hierarchy structure that grants men the power to decide what a woman can say or do. This language in the comments aims to bring Bushra back into the role of a &ldquo;proper Muslim woman&rdquo; punishing her for publicly giving her opinions on the grooming gangs. This act aligns with the concept of digital gender trolling where trolls exploit gendered stereotypes and cultural biases to intensify harm on women in online discourse (Mantilla, 2013). Online abuse towards female journalists based on the idea of gender performativity reaffirms patriarchal standards on modesty, religious observance and male authority. As a result, many other women may hesitate pursuing careers or air their views publicly in male dominated fields causing gender imbalance.<br /> <br />Fig 12: Screenshot from X<br /> <br />Fig 13: Screenshot from X</p>\n<p><br />Fig 14: Screenshot from X<br />5.5 Death threats<br />Death threats act as a form of online abuse towards female journalist like Samantha Smith who shared a screenshot of a message she got saying &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait for the day someone cuts your head off infront of a camera&hellip;&rdquo; (see Fig 15) Death threats towards female journalist aim to humiliate, silence and drive them out of public debate invoking fear in them. From feminist media studies perspective, these threats reflect how online harassment escalates for women covering sensitive topics creating psychological impact on the target. Death treats provoke anxiety, stress and a sense of vulnerability especially if the journalists suspects that it could escalate in real-world which could impact mental health. Professionally, some media outlets may feel the pressure to reassign female journalists from sensitive topics to try and protect them from harm, reinforcing the idea that female journalists should shy away from covering sensitive stories. When death threats go unpunished, society is at risk normalizing extreme hostility towards women in media, undermining efforts for respectful discourse.</p>\n<p><br /> <br />Fig 15: Screenshot from X<br />5.6 Male journalists<br />On the other hand, online harassment experienced by male journalists such as Piers Morgan, Charlie Peters, Stephen Pennell, Lewis Goodall and Jimmy the Giant reveal a different pattern compared to the female journalists. Digital criticism they get is based on professional stances, perceived biases or ideological leanings rather than personal or sexual threats. Piers Morgan for instance gets a comment saying &ldquo;You were part of the mainstream media at the time, so why weren&rsquo;t you speaking out about it every chance you had? It seems you cared more about self-preservation than standing up for the victims.&rdquo; (see Fig 16) This statement though critical, focuses on Piers&rsquo; role within the media and his failure to address the grooming gang scandal well. Similarly, Stephen Pennell is told &ldquo;Your full of shit and lies&rdquo; (see Fig 17) challenging his honesty and credibility rather than his right to speak or personal attacks. <br />Meanwhile, Lewis Goodall is referred to as &ldquo;Starmer's outrider&rdquo; (see Fig 18) and receives comments like &ldquo;Really Lewis, yesterday you let Philps off in his interview and now you attacking them!!! mate you are just shit at your job!!&rdquo; (see Fig 19) and &ldquo;Remind me of your record Lewis?&rdquo; (see Fig 20). In each instance Lewis is criticised for his perceived political bias and inconsistency in his reporting style. Jimmy the Giant faces similar critiques: &ldquo;is this the rigged report you are taking your data from?&rdquo; (see Fig 21) and &ldquo;Used to be a big fan of yours, but the past few months have really brought your ugly thoughts and beliefs to the surface for us all to see. You should've stuck to videos on subcultures, sports and free-running and stayed out of politics.&rdquo; (see Fig 22) The criticism is on his shift in content and ideological stances, suggesting that his fans feel disappointed and misled by his new direction. <br />Finally, Charlie Peters gets statements like &ldquo;With respect, you also need to confront the evil of WHY this is happening. Why is there a very obviously widespread view amongst Muslims that they can rape non-Muslim children?&rdquo; (see Fig 23) The comment framed Charlie as someone who needs to address issues more directly and does not degrade him with sexual insults or threaten him with violence. This difference underscores how misogyny in digital online spaces specifically target women&rsquo;s bodies, sexuality and personal attributes whereas men are criticised for what they say or do.<br /> <br />Fig 16: Screenshot from X<br /> <br />Fig 17: Screenshot from X<br /> <br />Fig 18: Screenshot from X<br /> <br />Fig 19: Screenshot from X<br /> <br />Fig 20: Screenshot from X</p>\n<p><br />Fig 21: Screenshot from X<br /> <br />Fig 22: Screenshot from X<br /> <br />Fig 23: Screenshot from X<br />6. CONCLUSION<br />In conclusion, the safety of UK female journalists is a compelling issue that raises questions about structural inequalities in the journalism industry, social media spaces and society in general. This research has shown ways in which female journalists in the UK face extreme levels of online abuse which is explicitly gendered aiming to delegitimize their presence in public spaces like X while male journalists are only subjected to online criticism based on the work they do. Online abuse towards female journalists is characterised by gendered slurs, sexualised threats, death threats and attempts to police their behaviour, appearance and credibility.<br />The findings of this research demonstrate how online misogyny operates and linked to traditional hegemonic gendered structures. Additionally, the research findings have shown how women who report on highly controversial topics like the grooming gang scandal are more likely to face extreme forms of online harassment. This kind of online abuse and harassment have a huge negative impact towards female journalists. Many are negatively impacted psychologically, ranging from fear, anxiety and depression to post-traumatic stress disorder. Despite these challenges, female journalists continue to resist and counteract online abuse. Many have developed coping mechanisms such as blocking and muting hate comments and forming of support networks which act as &lsquo;subaltern counter publics&rsquo; (Fraser, 1990).<br />Social media platforms have been criticised for their negligence and failure to adequately address online gender-based harassment, with many female journalists expressing frustrations over lack of consequences towards the perpetrators. This suggests the need for stronger institutional support, legal reforms and platform accountability to create a safer online environment for female journalists. Based on the findings of this research, several recommendations can be considered to safeguard female journalists in digital spaces like X. To begin with, media organisations and companies must take a proactive role in supporting their female journalists by providing online safety training, mental health support and legal assistance to those facing sever harassment. Employers should also adopt a zero-tolerance policy for online abuse directed at their journalists and work with social media companies to ensure that any hate comments and harmful content is swiftly removed.<br />Additionally, social media platforms must be held accountable for the role they play in enabling online gender-based harassment. While companies like X have implemented policies against hate speech and abuse in their platforms, enforcement of these policies remain inconsistent. These platforms need to strengthen their reporting mechanisms, improve content moderation and increase transparency about the actions taken against users who engage in online harassment especially towards female journalists. Governments also need to introduce stronger regulatory frameworks to ensure that digital platforms take meaningful action to protect female journalists from abuse.<br />Moreover, Legal reforms should be considered to address the issue of online harassment better as a form of gender- based violence. In the UK, current laws surrounding online abuse are inadequate, making it difficult for female journalists to seek legal justice against perpetrators. Policymakers should consider introducing specific laws that recognises the severeness of online gender- based harassment and provides transparent legal avenues for victims to take action against online bullies and harassers. Besides that, creating public awareness campaigns can play a crucial role in shifting societal attitudes toward online harassment. Misogyny in online spaces is often normalised or dismissed as &ldquo;just part of an online thing&rdquo; but this perception must be challenged. By raising awareness about the impact of online abuse towards female journalists and advocating for a culture of accountability, it is possible to foster a more respectable and inclusive digital environment.<br />This research has provided an understanding into the safety of female journalists in online spaces looking at the forms of harassment that they face compared to their male counterparts. While feminist movements have successfully pushed for greater gender equality and representation in media, they have also been met with backlash from individuals who still uphold traditional gender norms. By continuing to advocate for change and holding those in power accountable, progress can be made towards a future where female journalists can work without fear and where digital public sphere is truly open to all. Another critical question raised for future research is, has fourth wave feminism contributed to the rise in online harassment towards female journalists?</p>",
